NO KNEAD BLACK BREAD

  TAGS : sidedish sandwich black bread
  TIME : 60
  SERV : 2 loaves
  DESC
    & This beautiful black loaf of bread is what inspired this website it took me a while to get my hands on some bamboo charcoal powder but now that i have it i will be baking a ton of these. Some months ago I stumbled upon an image of an all-black loaf I didn't know you could get bread to be that dark. I tasted some squid ink in japan before in pasta and in korean gimbap so I assumed that's what they had used. Using squid ink to tint food wasn't particularly appealing to me so I was happy when i learned about Bamboo charcoal. 
    & Getting your hands on it isn't easy especially in Canada. I saw stores on amazon.com that sold it but nothing around my area. I bought a small amount at a health food store where I live but it wasn't much (also crazy expensive). After searching all over I concluded that the best place to get it was in Japan and since i travel there often I assumed it would be relatively easy to get. Wrong again. It's almost impossible to purchase in store or maybe i wasn't taking to the right people or going to the right places.
    % img/recipes/no.knead.black.bread.1.jpg
    & Finally found some available for purchase on amazon.co.jp or maybe i wasn't taking to the right people or going to the right places.
    % img/recipes/no.knead.black.bread.2.jpg
    & Finally found some available for purchase on amazon.co.jp since i lived in temporary housing shipping there wasn't ideal. Luckily a good friend agreed to have it shipped to her place and thankfully it arrived before i left the country. SO that's how i got my hands on bamboo charcoal powder! Wasn't easy but i got it from the best possible source through <a href=\"http://www.taketora.co.jp\">Taketora</a>. They've been growing and making things out of bamboo for years and years they're true artisans.
    & Cooking with bamboo charcoal is a breeze you don't need to add much to make your food black. It doesn't add taste to a recipe either it's purely aesthetic. While it doesn't add any distinct flavour
  INST
    - In a bowl, mix in 3 cups of all purpose flour, 2 tbsp of bamboo charcoal powder, 1 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp of active dry yeast. Make sure everything is mixed together well, your dough should turn a light grey colour. Don't worry, when you add water it will darken.
    - Add the 1 1/2 cups of water gradually, stirring it with a wooden spoon into a relatively cohesive dough. The dough will still be very wet, don't add extra flour.
    - Put a bag over the bowl and let the dough rest anywhere from 9 to 24 hours. Ideally you can just prepare the dough late evening and let it rest overnight, you don't need to do anything to it. 
    - Once the dough has risen, remove the plastic bag and place the dough on a lightly floured surface. Shape the dough into a ball, if its too wet to handle put some flour on your hands. You can make either one large loaf or two small ones with this recipe, i like to make two so i split the dough in half. Cover with plastic wrap.
    - Pre-heat your oven to 450F and place your bread pan or dutch oven in it. Once it's done pre-heating take out the pan and put your dough inside, sprinkle some poppy seeds and press lightly to get them to stick. 
    - Cover the bread pan with aluminum foil and put it back in the oven for 30 minutes <small>If using a dutch oven just put the lid on and put it inside, no foil is required</small>
    - After 30 minutes, take the foil (or lid) off and let it cook for another 7 minutes or so. This is just the bread browns at the top.

OVERNIGHT BANANA SPINACH OATMEAL

    & I bet you all remember the scene in the movie Hook when the lost boys are sitting in front of an invisible buffet trying to make Peter understand that he needs to imagine there is food on the table. The moment when that little switch turns in his head and he sees the feast i've been fantasizing over that scene for years. Strange playdoh-like food varying in colour texture and shape. I've been wanting to re-create that buffet to make something bizzare yet eatable and delicious. 
    & This oatmeal is an attempt at doing just that something that is very colourful bizzare and beautiful (and of course eatable). You can't identify what everything is right away what is that green goo? Cake batter? Very light pesto? I like to challenge people's ideas about food what is that green goo? Cake batter? Very light pesto? I like to challenge people's ideas about food pasta doesn't need to be beige and neither does your oatmeal.
    & The important part in this is that it's coloured naturally nothing artificial. For those who might worry about having spinach in oatmeal (or for breakfast) you can't really taste it in this. Also why shouldn't you have greens in the morning? We all have these pre-conceived ideas of what morning meals should look like or what they should include. Of course I'm not re-inventing breakfasts with this recipe it's still oatmeal. I like to think that i'm taking it a step further though in terms of what a morning meal can look like.
    & I'm one step closer to having my peter pan buffet now imagine a table full of dishes with this level of colour and texture! Amazing.

    & Because i made a fresh loaf of black bread the other day it only made sense to make another recipe with it so i made a delicious spicy and lime-infused carrot and avocado sandwich. 
    & Before I started to make this I was just thinking from a colour perspective i knew I wanted some orange in it and i had just purchased a fresh bag of carrots that same morning. I wanted layering colours so then i opted for avocado. A lot of times when i'm planning recipes I just think of what colours i want present and then try and find foods that fit only then do i start thinking about flavourings. 
    & I wanted something spicy and i love the lime/avocado mix so that's how it started. Planning recipes according to colour is important it creates more variety in your meal. The colours don't always have to contrast each other i wouldnt mind having an all-green sandwich (future recipe maybe? ).

    & Black pasta is visually striking I remember the first time I saw it on a shelf in a grocery store. I didn't know pasta could be that shade. Ever since that time I've been dying to make my own. Happy to say that i can finally cross that off my list of things I want to do.
    & Making fresh pasta at home is surprisingly easy it doesn't require a lot of preparation. It's something you can do on a weekend kneading dough is very relaxing. Just put some music on have a glass of wine and start cooking! It's something you can do by yourself but it's actually cool to do with a friend. Me and Devine actually made these while our friend Max was around.
    & The secret ingredient to making black pasta is Bamboo Charcoal powder. It's seldomly used to make pasta most of the time people will use squid ink. While it's harder to find it works better in pasta as it will not alter the taste of smell of your dough. I also strive to keep all of my recipes 100% vegan so squid ink is a definite no no. You can also make black pasta with black rice so squid ink is a definite no no. You can also make black pasta with black rice although the consistency and ingredients are very different.
    % img/recipe/black.pasta.1.jpg
    & To make pasta I use a pasta machine at home but you can easily do it by hand with just a rolling pin and a knife. I've made pasta using both methods it's good to try by hand first. Your first batch may not be perfect but that's ok you'll only get better with practice! It doesn't really matter anyway if they're uneven your noodles will still be delicious. The more batches you make the better they'll get!
    & I've made pasta solely using whole wheat flour in the past which have turned out delicious. The consistency is a bit different it doesn't have as much elasticity. I stumbled upon a recipe on <a href=\"http://minimalistbaker.com/homemade-vegan-pasta/\">Minimalist baker</a> and I really wanted to try it. Loved it so much I decided to base my recipe off of the same flours. So this recipe is all thanks to Minimalist baker and their ingenuity.
  INST
    * Preparing the dough
    - Mix 2 cups of wheat semolina, 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 1 tbsp of bamboo charcoal powder in a bowl. Make sure everything is evenly mixed.
    - Prepare a bowl of water, keep it close by. Add water to the flour mix gradually, a tablespoon's worth at a time. You can mix your dough by hand, or with a food processor. 
    - Keep adding water until your dough comes together. Your dough should be moist but not too sticky. <small>Add more flour if needed</small>
    - Knead until your dough is smooth, then form into a ball. Cover and let it rest for 30 minutes. Cut your dough into quarters.
    * With pasta machine
    - Roll out the dough to your desired thickness using your pasta machine. Run the dough about 5-6 times, running it over the largest setting first and then making your way down to a thinner setting. I went a knotch before the thinnest setting.
    - Once your dough is nice and flat, dust it with some extra flour and run it through the linguini or spaghetti setting. If you don't use enough flour your dough may stick inside the mechanism of your pasta machine and will make the process difficult. You can catch the noodles that are coming out with a chopstick, this will keep them from trying to stick together. 
    - If your dough still feels moist, add more flour. If they're too moist they will stick together, we don't want this. Once they've been dusted with enough flour, separate into 6 portions and fold each one over itself once, and then again to make a small bundle. 
    - Let dry for 30 minutes.
    * Using a rolling pin
    - roll out each quarter of dough to your desired thickness. Sprinkle extra flour if dough sticks to your rolling pin.
    - Fold each pasta sheet over itself a few times, again dusting it with enough flour so it doesn't stick. Folding makes it easier to cut and your noodles will be more even as a result.
    - Make wider cuts for linguini, thinner for spaghetti etc. If it's your first time making pasta by hand, make linguini. Making consistenly thin noodles is tough so i don't recommend it on your first try.
    - If your dough still feels moist, add more flour. If they're too moist they will stick together, we don't want this. Once they've been dusted with enough flour, separate into 6 portions and fold each one over itself once, and then again to make a small bundle.
    - Let dry for 30 minutes.
    * Boiling
    - If you want to have your fresh pasta right away, bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook for approximately 3 minutes, fresh pasta cooks a lot faster than the dry kind. 
    * Freezing
    - Transfer to a freezer bag. I like to use little pieces of parchment paper to keep the fresh pasta bundles separated.

    & I don't really buy bread anymore since i've discovered the joys of home-baking but i still like to go to my neighbourhood  bakery to get ideas and inspiration. My latest bread experiment is pretzels. 
    & Pretzels is something i've wanted to try and make for a while now beautifully-shaped breads are my favourite. I originally wanted to try and make another shape but since this was my first ever attempt i figured id go traditional. Though i suppose the shape is the only traditional thing about these pretzels.
    & You can find black breads in some japanese bakeries though it isnt that common here in Montreal. Sometimes i wonder if people would buy them unfortunately black is synonymous with 'burnt' for a lot of people.
    & Those who think this way are missing out ;). Black bread is fantastic.
    & This recipe was adapted from <a href=\"http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/homemade-soft-pretzels-recipe.html\">Alton Brown's recipe</a>. Im a newbie baker still learning a lot about it. It's great to have so many resources online to learn from! These pretzels are best eaten on the same day!

    - In a bowl, mix the 3/4 cup of warm water, the 1/2 tbsp of maple syrup and the tsp of salt. Sprinkle the tsp of yeast on top and let it sit for 5 minutes. 
    - In a separate bowl, stir 1 tsp of black bamboo powder* into 2 1/4 cups of all purpose flour. It's important to mix them together in this step because as soon as you add a wet ingredient it's harder to blend the colour in. Once your dough becomes an even 'grey', mix in 2 tbsp of coconut oil.
    - Combine the wet ingredients into your dry ingredients, adding the 'wet' ones gradually while mixing your dough.
    - You can mix the dough using your hands, start by mixing it until everything comes together. After you can take the dough out of the bowl and onto a lightly floured surface, continue to knead the dough using your hands until it becomes smooth. <small>your dough shouldnt stick to your hands but it shouldn't be too dry either. If ever you feel its too dry add a tiny bit of water, sometimes just wetting your hands lightly and kneading it into the dough is enough. If on the contrary your dough is too wet, add a bit of flour. ALWAYS add a little bit at a time</small>
    - Put your ball of dough into a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let it sit in a warm place for 50 minutes or until it has doubled in size.
    - Pre-heat your oven to 450F
    - Prepare a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, add a bit of vegetable oil over it. 
    - Put 5 cups of water into a pot along with 1/3 cup of baking soda. Bring to a boil. <small>You will be dipping your dough in this later, this is the step that helps create that beautiful gloss. Take your dough and cut it into 4 equal pieces. Roll out each piece into a long thin rope, the longer it is the bigger your pretzels will be.</small>
    - You can shape it however you want, but if you want a pretzel shape all you need to do is to first shape it into a U. Take the two ends and cross them over each other, then take the 'crossed ends' and bring it to the bottom of your U. Press it down.
    - Using a flat spatula, gently place one pretzel into the pot of boiling water for 30 seconds. Only put one piece at a time. After place them onto the baking sheet you prepared earlier.
    - Brush the pretzels with some soy milk and sprinkle with some fleur de sel.
    - Bake for 12 minutes and place on a cooling rack!

How things change! I buy beets regularly now to make pasta sauce to serve over salads to mix into smoothies and now to make Borscht!

    & Simple enough to make doesn't take a lot of time and it only requires 3 ingredients (aw yiss). The fewer ingredients I have the better I feel about the recipe. There's something satisfying about being able to make something that tastes amazing and that doesn't require a lot of preparation.
    & I backed a project on indie gogo last year for montreal's first vegan grocery store. Because i did I currently have a gift certificate to spend there. Once in a while I'll go and pick out a few things that i need (or that i want to experiment with). Last month I picked up whole cane sugar (Sucanat)! It's dehydrated sugar cane juice it can be used in baking other recipes instead of sugar. It has a strong and pleasant taste I rather like it. If you like the taste of molasses give it a try!

    - Put 1 cup of unsalted peanuts in a bowl, separate the halves. <small>If you're starting from shelled peanuts, de-shell and fry them in a pan with a bit of oil. Then rub off the skins. Mine were already de-shelled and unsalted, if you have that even better! You can usually purchase them at places where they sell dried goods in bulk. Like Anatol Spices in montreal.</small>
    - In a pan, bring 1/2 cup of whole cane sugar with 2 tbsp of water to a boil.
    - Stir often. If it starts to form strings when you pull your laddle out then it's perfect.
    - Pour the syrup over the peanuts and mix it up quickly with a spoon. <small>The syrup will harden, so this step needs to be done quick. Otherwise it'll clump up and you wont be able to work with it. If that happens you can put it back in a warm pan again to melt it down a bit </small>

Be careful not to burn yourself, feel free to use a spoon to scoop the mixture out. <small>You can also just pour the whole thing onto a pan and tap it down into a rectangle, flattening it with down with a spatula. It'll make bars instead of little balls, note that if you do make this shape instead you'll need to cut it into pieces early on.</small>

    & Late-night gyoza at izakaya is one of the things i miss the most about living in Tokyo. Maybe not one of the healthiest late night eats but a DELICIOUS one. I recently learned how to make them at home so it was only natural for me and Devine to try and make our own version. These are very unconventional gyoza black on the outside and red and orange on the inside.
    & Visually striking.
    % img/recipes/dark.yaki.gyoza.1.jpg
    & We made homemade gyoza dough with some friends a few weeks back it took FOREVER. Devine had the amazing idea of using our pasta maker to do it. We still needed to do a bit of kneading just to get it through the machine the first time. After that though it's easy and sweat-free!
    % img/recipes/dark.yaki.gyoza.2.jpg
    & We didn't have any round cookie cutters either the last time we tried i was using upside down glasses which werent amazing since the rims arent sharp. Again Devine had a stroke of genius. Cans! Had an old chickpea pan it was about the size of a gyoza wrapper so we used that to poke holes through the dough
    ? Genius right?
    & I know not everyone has a pasta maker you don't need one to make wrappers. You can just use a rolling pin.

    & You also dont have to make your dough you don't need one to make wrappers. You can just use a rolling pin.

She explains it really well too on her blog it's worth taking a look. I learned a lot from her even if our techniques differ slightly. While I preferred not to knead by hand or with a rolling pin i did do it her way the first time.

  INST
    * Dough
    - Mix 2 cups of all purpose flour with 1 tsp of bamboo charcoal powder* in a bowl.
    - Dissolve 1/2 tsp of salt in 1/2 cup of just-boiled water and pour into the flour little by little while mixing.
    - Knead the dough on a clean flat surface for a few minutes until it becomes smooth. <small>If your dough is too dry, add 1 tbsp of hot water and repeat as needed.</small>
    - Separate the dough in 3. Roll into balls and wrap them up with plastic wrap, refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. <small>Leaving it to rest in the refrigerator makes the dough easier to manipulate afterwards</small>
    - Flatten each piece out with a rolling pin into a rough rectangle, thin enough so that you can run it through the pasta maker. Pass it through your pasta maker a few times, incrementing down to the thinnest setting gradually. <small>You can use a rolling pin instead, it works but it takes a lot more effort. Both techniques work, this one just happens to be quicker and easier on your body. Note that depending on your pasta maker, the dough will come out a bit thicker than a traditional gyoza. If you want it thinner you can flatten it a bit more with a rolling pin</small>
    - Put the thin sheet of dough onto a clean flat surface. Take a can (with about a 3\" diameter) and start to poke holes into it, these are your gyoza wrappers! <small>You can use cookie cutters if you have some. I used an old chickpea can I had.</small>
    - Pile the wrappers, sprinkle some cornstarch (or potato starch) inbetween each piece so they don't stick together. Put a damp towel over your wrappers so they don't dry out.
    - Repeat this process for the other 2 portions of dough, and you can re-use the scraps and make new dough to run through the pasta maker (no waste~). 
    * Carrot filling
    - Mix the 1/4 block of tofu, the 1/3 cup of coriander, the 2 grated carrots and the 1 tsp of ginger root together in a bowl. Add a tbsp of soy sauce as well as black pepper and salt to taste. Mix once more. 
    * Beet filling
    - Mix the 1/4 block of tofu, the 1/3 cup of coriander, 1 grated red beet, the 2 garlic cloves and the tsp of ginger root. Add a tbsp of soy sauce and some ground sichuan peppercorns. 
    * Cooking
    - Take 1 wrapper, wet all around the edge with water using your fingers. <small>Keep a bowl of water close to dip your fingers in</small>
    - Put a spoonful of filling in the middle (carrot or beet).
    - Close it. Make little folds with the flap that is facing you using both hands, leaving the back part smooth. Make sure it's sealed tight. Repeat for the rest of the gyoza skins, alternate between fillings <small>Cover with a damp towel while you work so they don't dry up.</small>
    - Put some vegetable oil in a pan on medium heat. Add gyoza in 2 rows of 3 in the pan. Cook until bottom becomes golden.
    - Add 1/3 cup of water and put a lid on. Let steam until all the water evaporates. 
    - Add a bit of sesame oil and cook until crispy. Serve with a dipping sauce!

    & It's my green holiday quiche! Pureed tofu with onions and spinach topped with zucchini slices on a black crust!
    & Been wanting to make a black pie crust for a while. I originally wanted to make an actual pie with the top and all but i can only have so much dough in one sitting. A quiche seemed like a better option. I probably will try and make a pie at some point though just because I REALLY liked making designs on the outer edge and if i made one with a sheet of dough on top i could also make designs on there. I don't make meals like this often must be because it's almost christmas. Pie dough goes hand in hand with christmas in my family.
    & Getting back to the black crust sometimes I wonder if there's anyone else out there that's just as excited as I am at the thought of making a recipe black. Love the contrast it creates it really brings out the green and orange. I unfortunately didn't have a pretty plate to present it in all the plates I have are square... they're square and too small for this quiche.

Devine's mom is a big Ricardo fan she makes a lot of his recipes she makes a lot of his recipes his cookbook is always lying around somewhere in her kitchen. He's a famous cook here in Quebec.
    & This quiche was fun to research and make. Making beautiful arrangements requires a bit of inspiration and patience. The little carrot flower is simple to make just cut out really thin slices of carrot and place them in a circle making smaller circles as you near the center. Thin carrot slices look like petals! The moment you serve slices of the quiche your flower is destroyed so be sure to take a photo first!

    & Végé pâté is a quebec staple food one of those things that you never think to make yourself. Every picnic i had this summer included this. It's great with veggies on crackers in sandwiches... needless to say it got expensive after a while. Buying pre-made goods is always more costly which is why i started to make it myself.
    & Those who know me know that i like japanese food a lot I cook it every week. I wanted to try to make a pâté with japanese inspiration!
    & Adding miso was an obvious choice that as well as soy sauce ginger and scallions. All things that i had in my kitchen and that i knew would be delicious as a spread.
    & A lot of végé pâté recipes call for whole wheat flour I've made it using that before and it's great. If you don't have oats you can use whole wheat flour instead. Although using oats as a substitute works great I've made it using that before and it's great. If you don't have oats you can use whole wheat flour instead. Although using oats as a substitute works great i always have a bucket-load of steel-cut oats lying around. I just throw it in my food processor until it gets a flour-like consistency.
    & While it isn't currently picnic season in Montreal i still make this regularly and you should too!

    & Been looking for ways to eat persimmon in recipes other than dessert. Don't get me wrong it's great to have as pudding or on its own but I always thought it could make a great sauce for pasta.
    & Pumpkin is amazing when made into sauce it's also something that is often used in desserts... so maybe persimmon would work too? I wasn't in the mood for pasta that day so this curry happened instead.
    & So GOOD...!
    & Persimmon and curry powder are amazing together sweet and tangy. Pairing it with onions and garlic makes it even tastier.
    & There are many different varieties of curry powders it's just a pre-mixed combination of different ground spices. It may be more economical to just buy that unless your pantry is full of spices. Making the powder yourself is great because you can opt out certain spices or herbs that you don't like. Typically mixes have turmeric, coriander, cumin, black and red pepper, cinnamon cloves, fennel seeds, cardamom, ginger and fenugreek. There can be as much as 20 different spices. You can play around with the amount of each im sure itll be delicious either way. I have a lot of spices here but i like taking the easy way out sometimes

My sister's birthday was coming up and my parents really wanted make a themed cake for her... of what you ask?
    & Something old. Something new. Something borrowed...
    & Something blue!
    & You guessed correctly a tardis
    % img/recipes/simple.doctor.who.cake.1.jpg
    & They asked for a quote from their favourite bakery while they do great work it was a bit out of their price range. So my parents turned to me and my cake-baking adventure began.
    & My sister likes lemon cake so for sure it would need to be lemon-flavoured. That part didn't worry me. I didn't want to make a full tardis but i knew that i wanted the cake to be tardis blue. That colour is completely unnatural. Those royal blue raw blueberry pinterest cakes are complete bullshit. I had to go for food colouring I don't usually use those but in this case the tint was important. So i went ahead and bought Wilton's royal blue and violet colouring to get it be that specific shade. Just using royal blue would have made it go turquoise.
    & The cake noob that i am i didn't want to mess it up. Wanted my sister to have a half-decent cake. So I searched around and found a very awesome <a href=\"http://thegreenforks.com/vegan-birthday-cake/\">lemon cake recipe</a> by Laura i didn't want to mess it up. Wanted my sister to have a half-decent cake. So I searched around and found a very awesome <a href=\"http://thegreenforks.com/vegan-birthday-cake/\">lemon cake recipe</a> by Laura author of The Green forks. I adapted her recipe for this it turned out absolutely perfect. I only referenced her cake batter recipe for this cake though the tofu lemon curd filling was inspired by <a href=\"http://www.culinate.com/recipes/collections/Contributors/Zena+Chew/vegan_lemon_layer_cake\">Zena Chews</a>. Couldn't have done it without their recipes.

    & I didn't want to make a super sugary cake either so i decided to not add frosting. Opted for a powdered sugar dusted cake. Saw a lot of people making crazy tardis cakes made out of fondant. I personally HATE the taste of fondant while it helps to make beautiful cake art i just don't like it. Plus im not entirely sure i would have been able to pull off a decent fondant the tutorials i watched convinced me of that. Too high-level for me.
    & I wanted to make something clean something minimalistic. Then came the image of the tardis drifting through space. That image was simple. Evocative. So i cut out a tardis stencil

    * Lemon curd
    - Puree 2 cup of silken tofu, 2 tbsp of canola oil, 1 tbsp of lemon zest, 3 tbsp of maple syrup, 1/4 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract. Don't overmix.
    - Refrigerate for a few hours to give it time to thicken.
    * Tardis stencil
    - Print out your image in your prefered size, i just grabbed an image of the tardis that i found online.
    - With a fine cutting tool start cutting out the shape, I didn't take a photo that had lettering, the detail is just too fine and there is enough information that will make it obvious that it's a tardis. Be sure to cut out the windows, that detail is key.
    * Cake
    - Pre-heat oven at 350F
    - Grease two 8" cake pans, set aside.
    - In a bowl mix 2 1/4 cups of all purpose flour, 1 1/2 cups of sugar, 3/4 tsp of baking soda and 3/4 tsp of salt.
    - In a separate bowl, stir 1 1/2 cups of cold water with 3/4 cup of canola oil, 1 tbsp of vanilla extract, 3 tbsp of lemon juice and 1 tsp of lemon zest.
    - Combine wet ingredients into the dry ones, mix well. Stir in 1 tsp of royal blue food colouring with 1 drop of violet food colouring.
    - Pour cake batter into pans, at the 30 minute mark insert a toothpick in the center of the cake. If it comes out clean it's ready. Otherwise bake for an additional 5 minutes.
    - Let cool, slice part of the curved top off of one of the cakes to even it out. Brush with a generous serving of the tofu lemon curd, place second cake layer over it and press down gently.
    - Place tardis stencil over the cake 
    ? Make sure the top is completely dry, put some powdered sugar in a sifter or fine mesh strainer. Hold over the cake and gently shake it onto the cake until it's covered to your liking. Make sure to put enough around the stencil so the shapes comes out nicely.

    & Bread pudding was one of my favourite desserts when I was a kid. We would usually have some after the holidays since that was the time where we could get the most left-over bread crusts. All thanks to my aunt's crust-less sandwiches! She would usually just give the bag of crusts to my mom which she in turn used to make bread pudding :).
    % img/recipes/mason.jar.bread.pudding.1.jpg
    & I asked my mom for her personal bread pudding recipe but she told me that it was best to just watch her do it. There aren't really any specific measurements she just makes it from memory. That's the case with most of her recipes most of them have never been written down. That's about to change though! I asked her to make a little booklet for me.
    & I like the idea of having a book of 'mom food' mom food is the best.
    & When she makes bread pudding she makes a basin-full of it my dad never has trouble going through all of it. He sure loves his desserts!
    & As much as id like to make a bucketload of bread pudding at home me and Devine would NEVER get through the whole thing. I don't like eating the same thing for a week so I adapted my mom's bread pudding into a single-serving one. The mason jar I have I believe is a wide-mouthed 1/2 pint jar.
    & It's also egg and dairy free!

    & Introducing my basic black bread recipe. This bread is super light and fluffy great for morning toast or sandwiches.
    & I've been reading up a lot about bread there's so many kinds out there. I wanted to understand how the ingredients we add can change the texture of the bread that and the differences in temperature to knead or not to knead etc. 
    & Truth is it really all depends on the type of bread you want.
    % img/recipes/basic.black.bread.1.jpg
    & I REALLY wanted to make a sandwich bread with a light crumb that bounces right back when touched.
    & The one I made this time around has more fat which in turn makes it softer and fluffier. The fat that you use will also change the texture/taste of the bread if you use margarine instead of vegan butter or even coconut oil for instance. You can use less of it or even coconut oil for instance. You can use less of it or more too. Again it depends on the texture you want. A lot of people wont like the idea of adding 'fat' to a recipe know that fat isn't synonymous with unhealthy. Too much of it can be bad of course but if used in moderation there really isn't anything to worry about.
    & Moderation and balance is key :)
    & There are many things you can do to help soften your bread brushing the outside with a little oil or fat as soon as you take it out of the oven will make the outside less crunchy. You can also substitute milk (soy almond etc.) for the water for a richer taste. There are so many different things to think about when baking!
    & I made this loaf for a brunch I had with friends we wanted to have fondue with a set I got as a gift during the holidays. We just cut the loaf into cubes and dunked it in! Soft bread is perfect for fondue!

    - In a large bowl, stir 1 1/2 tsp of salt and 3/4 tbsp of maple syrup in 1 cup of warm water until dissolved. Sprinkle tsp of active dry yeast, let sit for 10 minutes.
    - Sift 1 1/2 cups of all purpose flour, 1 1/2 cups of whole grain flour and 1 tsp of bamboo charcoal powder together in a separate bowl. Once flours are mixed evenly enough.
    - Add 1 tbsp of vegan butter (earth balance) to the water mix, then stir in 1/2 cup of the flour mix with a wooden spoon. Keep adding flour a 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough stops sticking to the sides. 
    - Put ball of dough on lightly floured counter-top and start kneading, add a bit of flour everytime it starts to stick to your hands. Knead for 15 minutes. <small>You may not use up all of your flour, if there's still a lot left and your dough is nice smooth don't add any more. Don't want to risk drying it out </small>
    - Heat up oven at the very lowest setting. This will be our warm place for bread rising. 
    - Grease up a bowl and put the dough, rolling it once to cover all sides. Cover with a cloth and place in oven. Let rise for 45 minutes.
    - Your bread should have doubled in size. Take bread out of oven, knead a few times and shape into a 10-11 inch cigar. Sprinkle some corn semolina on a baking sheet and place bread on top, this will keep it from sticking. Slash the top of the bread in the middle, doing this will keep the ends of the bread from splitting. Mist top of bread lightly with water, then add white sesame seeds. Press lightly to make them stick. Cover loaf with a cloth, put back in oven to rise for an additional 45 minutes. <small>If you don't want a traditional bread shape, put bread in a greased loaf pan to rise.</small>
    - Turn oven up to 350F . Bake for 30 minutes, or until it sounds hollow when tapped at the bottom.
    - Brush sides lightly with coconut oil (or butter) then let cool on a pile of towels, or a cooling rack if you have one.
    * Burger buns
    - Repeat steps 1 to 6.
    - Instead of forming into a 'cigar' shape at step 7, divide into 8 pieces and shape into a tight ball. Sprinkle baking sheet with some corn semolina and put buns on top. Cover and let rise for another 45 minutes in the warmed oven.
    - Take buns out of oven, brush lightly with vegan butter and put white sesame seeds on top. Bake uncovered for 20 minutes at 350F .
    - Let cool on a pile of towels or cooling rack.
    * Hot dog buns
    - Repeat steps 1 to 6. Divide through into 15 pieces and shape into small cylinders (or general elongated hot dog shape). Sprinkle baking sheet with some corn semolina and put buns on top. Cover and let rise for another 45 minutes in the warmed oven.
    - Take buns out of oven, brush lightly with vegan butter. Bake uncovered for 20 minutes at 350F .

    & Japanese konbini always have a ton of fun flavours for crackers and chips. Anything shiso or ume flavoured would be insta-buys for me i remember one that had a mix of wasabi and ume <3. Stuff like that isn't as available in Montreal as they are over there but at least you can find other things like shichimi togarashi! If you like spicy snacks this is for you!
    & Ume and shiso aren't anything like shichimi togarashi it's quite spicy in comparison. Originally i wanted to make senbei but since i recently purchased a bag of chickpea flour i wanted to have a recipe using that. Senbei is typically made with rice flour and/or rice left-overs. I don't typically have rice left-overs on hand we usually just eat it all on the same day. I never make extras.
    & When i decided i was going to make this i didn't have any shichimi togarashi left so I made my own! if you have a well-stocked spice rack you can easily make it yourself. 'Shichimi togarashi' essentially means '7-flavour chili pepper'. If you have some already at home you can just use that but if you don't all you need is to grind these spices together - 
    & 2 tbsp chili flakes but if you don't all you need is to grind these together - 2 tbsp chili flakes 1 tbsp sanshou (sichuan peppercorns) 1 tbsp roasted orange peel 1 tbsp black sesame seeds 1 tbsp white sesame seeds 2 tsp ground ginger and 2 tbsp nori (or aonori).
    % img/recipes/shichimi.togarashi.crackers.1.jpg
    & Some people substitute sichuan peppercorns for black peppercorns i don't reccommend doing that. To me they're not interchangeable. Sichuan peppercorns is what makes it taste awesome it's one of my favourite spices. It's a numbing pepper with a really distinctive taste and aroma. If you eat one peppercorn you'll notice right away that it numbs your tongue and alters your sense of taste

BLACK GNOCCHI
  DATE : 2015-01-21
  TAGS : black pasta dinner
  TIME : 60
  SERV : 6 servings
  DESC
    & A few weeks ago I asked people what they wanted to see me cook some of you asked for black gnocchi so here they are! Made completely from scratch... beautiful and black with a light and sweet sauce topped with fresh scallions and daikon!
    & As it turns out making gnocchi takes a LOT of time. It's well worth the effort but if you're planning on making some clear your afternoon or get a friend to help.
    % img/recipes/black.gnocchi.1.jpg
    & I started cooking these pretty early in the day around 9 in the morning. Every step takes time baking the potatoes... waiting for them to cool down removing the skins etc. Can't skip ANY step either doing that will result in a gnocchi disaster. Nothing worse than an uneatable meal.
    & Wasn't the case for these they turned out perfect! Plus this is a fairly big recipe so if you're only two you'll have plenty left-over that you can let dry freeze and eat later.
    % img/recipes/black.gnocchi.2.jpg
    & I had a really specific idea for the topping I wanted a ton of scallions with mushrooms and seaweed. I miss the pasta in italian restaurants in japan they always had some with regular italian-style noodles but with japanese-style toppings like nattou shiso etc. Since i'm currently on a shichimi togarashi binge (left-over from my cracker recipe) I included some in this recipe as well.
    % img/recipes/black.gnocchi.3.jpg
    & Because the sauce is light you can focus on the texture of the gnocchi that with the grated daikon. Do NOT omit the daikon it's so good. Really happy that daikon is so easy to find in grocery stores here now it's one of my favourite veggies.
  INST
    * Gnocchi
    - Preheat oven to 400F . Bake potatoes until fork tender. Peel skins off and mash them up with a fork or food processor. Let cool completely <small>You can also boil them until fork tender</small>
    - Sift 1 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour, 1 tbsp bamboo charcoal powder and 1 pinch of sea salt together in a bowl.
    - Mix in the potatoes gradually, knead until you get a consistent dough. <small>You may not need to use all of the potatoes, rarely are potatoes the exact same size. If the dough feels ok stop mixing in extra potatoes</small>
    - Put a bit of flour on your working surface and divide your ball of dough into 4, roll each section into a long rope with an approximate 2cm diameter.
    - Proceed to cutting up the ropes into 2cm sections. To make the little lines over the gnocchis, take each piece and make a ball with it. Press it up against the backside of a fork and slide it down all the way to the ends with your finger. Your ball will be left with sets of lines on top and will take its signature elongated shape.
    - Cook gnocchi in a pot of boiling water with a bit of sea salt, the bits that are ready will float back to the surface.
    * Sauce
    - Rehydrate 1/2 a cup's worth of shiitake mushrooms in a cup of boiling water. When shiitake are soft, remove the tails and cut into slices.
    - Rehydrate wakame as well in a separate cup. Let stand for 5 minutes, drain, rinse and cut into smaller pieces.
    - Chop up 5 scallions and grate 1/3 cup's worth of daikon. Squeeze water out of daikon and set aside.
    - Mix 6 tbsp of soy sauce, 3 tbsp of mirin and 4 tsp of sugar in a bowl.
    - When Gnocchi are ready, sauté in a pan with the sauce and shiitake. Serve them into bowls and top first with wakame, scallions and then a dollop of grated daikon. Sprinkle some shichimi togarashi on top!

DARK KIMCHI BURGER

    & I make kimchi at home every now and then I made a batch last week and was looking for ideas of recipes i could make with it. Then came the idea of a kimchi burger! Korean-style with a miso gochujang sauce and a lentil-based patty.
    & Making kimchi from scratch is simple you need to let it ferment for a little while though. Kimchi only gets better with time! I used a recipe i found on <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Kimchi\">wikibooks</a>. I omitted the onion and the jeot gal.
    & If you're looking to make a seafood-less jeot gal know that it's possible and it doesn't change the taste of the dish at all (or at least it tasted fine to me and i've had a LOT of kimchi). I referenced a recipe i found online all you need to do is seaweed garlic peppercorns soy sauce and water. Just follow the steps and quantities in <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Fish_Sauce_(Vegan)\">this recipe</a>.
    & If you want to have black burger buns please refer to my <a href=\"http://grimgrains.com/basic+black+bread\">basic black bread recipe.</a>. If you scroll to the bottom you'll find the instructions for turning a whole loaf into 8 burger buns. You can freeze some of the extra buns for later :). The steps are basically the same as the loaf please refer to my <a href=\"http://grimgrains.com/basic+black+bread\">basic black bread recipe.</a>. If you scroll to the bottom you'll find the instructions for turning a whole loaf into 8 burger buns. You can freeze some of the extra buns for later :). The steps are basically the same as the loaf the main difference is the baking time and when you need to separate the dough into portions. Making bread doesn't require a lot of 'action' from your part a lot of your time will be spent waiting. Just make the dough on a lazy sunday morning :)! Using fresh buns makes a world of difference for a burger.

    & I'm really glad i got to make a black burger bun with white sesame seeds McDonalds in japan had a campaign during halloween where they had a bun like that. Been wanting to redo it myself since then :P. Today is a black food milestone for me!
    & For the patty i wanted to make something that wouldn't be too overpowering since kimchi has a really strong taste. I usually make my burger patties with tofu or beans but i had neither so i went with what i had in my pantry, a fuckton of red lentils.
    & Finally the miso/gochujang sauce is one that i often make to serve over veggies felt it would add an extra 'korean' touch to this dish :).

    * Burgers
    - Put 1/2 cup of red lentils with 3/4 cup of water in a pot, bring to a boil and then reduce the heat. Let simmer for 15 minutes or until lentils are soft.
    - In a pan, heat 1 tbsp of olive oil on medium heat. Add the minced garlic clove, cook for a minute and then add the carrot, grated ginger root and ground cumin to the pan. Cook for 3 minutes.
    - In a small bowl, mix 1 tbsp of ground flax seeds with 3 tbsp water. Let thicken for a few minutes and set aside.
    - In a bowl, mix the cooked lentils with the sauteed carrots, chopped scallions, sea salt, black pepper, the quick-cooking oats and the flax seed 'egg' mixture.
    - Form into patties. Heat up 1 tbsp of olive oil in a pan and cook the patties until the sides are crispy and golden. Since lentil patties tend to be a bit softer you might have to cook them for longer.
    - Top with some ready-made (or homemade) kimchi! <small>If you want to make it at home, follow this wonderful <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Kimchi\">kimchi recipe</a>.

    & This week is La Poutine Week! Montreal restaurants put their poutine skills to the test in an attempt to win the title of 'best poutine in the city'. Thought i would celebrate by making my own, The FAUX-maggio roasted beet poutine! Sweet potato fries with a blanket of faux-cheese and topped with roasted beets.
    % img/recipes/fauxmaggio.poutine.1.jpg
    & I have to admit that adding beets to a poutine was inspired by the one currently being served at <a href=\"http://lapoutineweek.com/montreal/the-poutines/chez-boris\">Chez Boris</a> theirs has more of a tex-mex feel with the beets mixed in with beans and chili peppers. I thought cubed beets looked beautiful atop a poutine!
    & The 'cheese' sauce is actually just inspired off a pasta sauce I make regularly at home. Because i don't eat dairy and am allergic to cashew cheese I usually make a nutritional yeast/mustard/turmeric/miso sauce. It mimics the look and taste of cheese. 
    & It would actually be just as delicious without the cauliflower bits but being a big cauliflower fan i just add it to everything.

    & Yes you could say i'm beet crazy. Trust me if you're not a fan this sauce will make you change your mind.
    & I've had this sauce many times with pasta or just as a simple vinaigrette for lazy weekday green bowls.
    & To prepare this orgasmic recipe just wash the beets cut them into wedges toss them with a bit of oil and herbs and toss them in the oven for 40 minutes it's that simple! If they're organic you can keep the skin on otherwise peeling them is a better idea.

    & If you have a fresh plant LUCKY YOU! Otherwise store-bought herbs will do :) know that if you do buy a bouquet of mint you can keep them fresh longer if you do these simple steps - Tear off any wilted leaves wash the mint gently put the stalks in a glass with a bit of water put a plastic bag over it and stick it in the fridge.

    & Burmese tofu is actually not really tofu i know that's confusing... it was for me too. At first i just thought it was tofu blended with turmeric. Burmese tofu is chickpea based! The cool thing about it is that it literally takes 10 minutes to make and 1 hour to set. It's a great soy-free alternative or if you're just looking to change things up. The texture is somewhat similar and hey...

    & This recipe will use up about half of it which means you'll have a whole other half to use in other meals :D.
    & At first i was maybe going to serve it over the rice as is no sauce. But then i remembered the mock eel i made a few months ago the sauce that is typically served over eel kabayaki is a caramelly and sweet sauce that i thought would fit PERFECTLY over this. So once again i made a mess dirtied more dishes... (whined a little) and made a batch!
    & Most japanese sauces are easy to make and usually require around 3-4 ingredients. These almost always include soy sauce, sake, mirin, or rice vinegar.
  INST
    * Rice
    - Prepare the black glutinous rice, it needs to be prepared at a 2:1 water to rice ratio. If you prepare 1 cup of dry rice you need to 2 cups of water.
    - Put 1 1/2 tbsp of rice vinegar, 1 tbsp of whole cane sugar, 1/2 tsp of sea salt in a sauce pan. Stir over low heat until sugar is dissolved.
    - Once rice is cooked, transfer to a flat tray and pour sushi dressing over it. Mix into rice using a sideways cutting motion. Cover with a damp towel and let cool.
    * Unagi sauce
    - Mix 2 tbsp soy sauce, 2 tbsp mirin, 1 tbsp whole cane sugar and 1 tbsp sake. Bring to a boil in a pot, lower heat and let thicken for a few minutes.
    * Chickpea tofu
    - Bring 1 1/2 cups of vegetable bouillon to a rolling boil in a pot.
    - Mix 1 cup of chickpea flour with 1/4 tsp sea salt and 1/2 tsp ground turmeric. Add 1 1/2 cups of vegetable bouillon and stir until the mixture is lump-free.
    - Lower to medium heat and pour in chickpea batter. Whisk continuously for 5-10 minutes until thickened. Pour into a 8x8 baking dish lined with parchment paper. Smooth out top with the back of a wooden spoon.
    - Let cool and set for 1 hour, then refrigerate for a little while longer before cutting. This will give the 'tofu' time to set properly. Cut into 12 pieces, and then cut in 2 again lenghtwise to make them fit over nigiri. <small>Note that this recipe makes a lot of extra chickpea tofu, i used about half of it.</small>
    - Preheat oven to 350F.
    - Line backing sheet with aluminium foil, line up pieces of chickpea tofu. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove from oven, brush chickpea tofu with unagi sauce and bake for an additional 15 minutes.
    * Combine
    - Shape tablespoons of black rice into oblongs, smear tops with a bit of wasabi, lay a nori strip texture-side up, place strip of chickpea tofu as well as the rice ball (wasabi side facing downwards) and finally fold nori over bottom of rice (cut off excess, you can wet the edges with a bit of water if ever it isn't sticking). Makes about 12 nigiri. <small>If you have nigiri molds, shaping the rice into ovals will be very easy. Otherwise use your hands, keep them moist so the rice doesn't stick. </small>

    & Worry not that gooey yellow mass is not cheese. It's pureed Mango! HO YES...! Black sesame rice pancakes with a generous dollop of mango because sometimes we all need a break from maple syrup.
    & Made matcha rice pancakes for Devine a few days go since I made a double recipe we ended up having some extra left-over. It doesn't keep that well so i figured we could just eat it that same night. We usually just have fruit for dessert so i paired the remaining 2 pancakes with a bit of fresh mango and MAN! Tasted so damn GOOD together!
    & SO inevitably I made it into a recipe except i didn't want to make matcha flavoured pancakes again so i opted for black sesame :)! The nutty taste of sesame paired with mango is so flavourful neither are excessively sweet too. I'm not too fond of really sugary desserts dressing pancakes with maple syrup is quite good but afterwards i always feel like my heart is going to burst right out of my chest alien-style.
    & No one likes that dressing pancakes with maple syrup is quite good but afterwards i always feel like my heart is going to burst right out of my chest alien-style.

    & Using fruit instead of syrup is a good way to cut down on sugar. It didn't need it really mangos are quite good and sweet on their own.
    & You can see in the photos that not all of the pancakes are the same size so this roughly makes about 12-10 small ones.. or a few bigger ones. Making them the same size is boring anyway IM NOT A ROBOT.

    * Pancake
    - Heat 1/4 cup of black sesame seeds in a non-stick pan at medium heat, remove once they start to pop. Let cool, then crush into a powder with a mortar and pestle. <small>As much as you can, it'll just make it a bit easier to mix afterwards</small>
    - Stir 1 1/4 cup of soy milk and 1 tsp of vanilla extract together, add 1/4 cup of ground black sesame seeds and blend using an immersion blender until you get a smooth grey liquid.

MUSHROOM ZUCCHINI PASTA

    & As much as i love pasta i like to vary my food a lot day to day so once in a while I like to make zucchini noodles! They're ready in an instant and really delicious when topped with a two-mushroom velouté sauce. This meal is also green on green most of the ingredients are different shades of the same colour. 
    & Yes those are the sort of details that I really care about.
    & What green things can i add to this? Wakame for starters! I don't always have salads in my fridge when i don't i'll usually just use wakame. It's super handy to have around because it keeps for a long time since it's dried doesn't require a lot of prep either.
    % img/recipes/mushroom.zucchini.pasta.1.jpg
    & Edamame is another green food that I like very much. Mine were frozen initially so i had to let them thaw out first I got the type that is already de-shelled. Saves a lot of time. Make sure to get the unsalted kind!
    & Mushrooms sure as hell aren't green but they do add a TON of flavour to sauces. Shiitake mushrooms especially have a lot of flavour but they do add a TON of flavour to sauces. Shiitake mushrooms especially have a lot of flavour shimeji mushrooms are bit more subtle but they look really nice in a dish and they have a really fun texture. I had both on hand and besides combining many kinds of mushrooms together is never a bad thing.
    % img/recipes/mushroom.zucchini.pasta.2.jpg
    & Of course you can make this recipe using regular pasta but it wont be green... unless you use spinach pasta (which could look really good too). Or matcha pasta? A really awesome girl on twitter made some using my black pasta recipe as a base they look gorgeous!
    & As always if you make this don't hesitate to share your photos with me here in the comments below on twitter @grimgrains or on instagram 'grimgrains'. It's simple
  INST
    - Rehydrate 2 tbsp of wakame in water, drain and set aside.
    - Cut stems off of a 1/4 cup of shiitake mushrooms, rehydrate by pouring boiling water over them, keep them submerged for 30 min or up to 1 hour. <small>It's better to rehydrate them overnight, for a minimum of 8 hours. The flavour will be stronger if you do, if you're in a rush though boiling water is fine. If you have fresh shiitake you can also skip this step</small>
    - Cut 4 medium-sized zucchinis thinly using a julienne peeler (or spiralizer), place in bowls. <small>I don't always cook my zucchini, but if you prefer a warm version sauté them in a pan with a bit of oil.</small>
    - Put 2 tbsp of olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat, whisk in 2 tbsp of all purpose flour until it's completely absorbed by the oil. Let roux cook for a minute or so.
    - Stir in 2 cups of vegetable bouillon, bring heat up to a boil and then lower to a simmer. Add a 1/4 cup of shiitake mushrooms and a 1/4 cup of shimeji mushrooms and a 1/3 cup of edamame to the sauce. Let cook for 10 minutes, season sauce with sea salt and black pepper and add the wakame. Serve over zucchini pasta.

    & Whenever i ask Devine what he wants to eat first he'll say pasta. I don't always say yes to this not unless i want to eat pasta everyday. Secondly he'll ask for Pâté Chinois. Which for me is always hard to say no to so i succumb... peek into the fridge and see what variation of it i can make. Thankfully it's a super versatile dish! With layers consisting of tofu and burmese tofu green peas and sweet potato/cauliflower you can't go wrong.
    % img/recipes/pate.chinois.1.jpg
    & Pâté Chinois is very much like Shepherd's pie which is why i will use these 2 terms interchangeably in this recipe. I suppose you could translate it to 'chinese pie' but that sounds strange to me. Especially considering that this dish is not chinese but that sounds strange to me. Especially considering that this dish is not chinese i'm not entirely sure why it bears that name. It's a quebec french term i prefer to use that since i grew up with it.
    & nMy mom made this all the time she would make the traditional meat version with corn and all. My meals are always meatless so naturally i don't make it the same way she does. Though to me it inspires the same kind of comfort.
    % img/recipes/pate.chinois.2.jpg
    & I've made versions of this dish with just cauliflower or just using tofu... or just potatoes. I've made it so often i've gone through every possibility. This Pâté Chinois happened because me and Devine both wanted different things...
    & I wanted cauliflower... 
    & ...he wanted sweet potato. 
    & I wanted burmese tofu...
    & ...he wanted tofu.

    & So what did we do? MEH lets just combine it all so that way both of us will get what we want! Ever since i discovered <a href=\"http://grimgrains.com/sweet+mock+eel+nigiri\">burmese tofu</a> i've been making it regularly so it's simple for me to add it to recipes. If you don't have time to make it (it only takes 15 minute of active prep time
  INST
    - Preheat oven to 375F.
    - Bring a pot of water (or vegetable bouillon for added flavour) to a boil, cook 1 cubed large sweet potato as well as 1 cup of chopped white cauliflower florets until tender. Drain, mix with 1 tsp of smoked paprika and puree with an immersion blender. Season with sea salt and black pepper. Set aside.
    - Take 1/2 a block of firm tofu and mash it down using a fork or just using your hands. I just squish it with my fingers to get a crumbly texture. Do the same for 1 cup of burmese tofu, mash it down and mix it with the tofu. <small>You can see my other recipe to find out how to make burmese tofu, alternatively you can just use 1 whole block of tofu instead.</small>
    - In a large pan, brown the yellow onion with a bit of oil. Add the tofu/burmese tofu, add 2 tbsp of soy sauce and 1 drop of liquid smoke (optional). Cook for a few minutes. Season with black pepper and sea salt. Press into bottom of a 8x8 baking dish.
    - Cover with the contents of 1 can of unsalted green peas (reserve a few for the top) and with the pureed cauliflower/sweet potato. Smooth with a spatula, decorate with some green peas and sprinkle with smoked paprika.

My mac n 'cheese' has whole grain macaroni noodles served with a faux-cheese consisting of golden beets roasted red peppers nutritional yeast and other delicious ingredients. Also topped with some roasted green chiles for a bit of a kick!
    & I've been experimenting a lot with faux-cheeses recently my choices are somewhat limited because of my nut allergy. But it's all good having limitations just means i need to get more creative! Everyday i try and think of alternatives to things i used to eat like cheese... dairy or even things i still eat.

Would have never thought of adding red peppers to a faux-cheese recipe she uses a marinated kind but really just using a fresh oven-roasted pepper is fine. So naturally she gets a huge THANK YOU.
    & For the faux-cheese sauce i was going to just use potatoes at first to make it more 'creamy'. I went to get the ingredients i needed for the recipe at the grocery and i saw some golden beets on sale. Golden beets being yellow i thought wouldn't alter the colour of the sauce and it would be a nice alternative to potatoes. Beets aren't as neutral as potatoes but i went for it anyway because beets are sweet and i feel like it could be an interesting add-on

    & The key to making a good crust is to have everything be extra cold the water should be ice cold as well as the vegan butter. You can shred the cold (or frozen) butter on top of your dry ingredients cutting the dough with a knife and getting it down to pea-sized bits is much harder. Shredding it over the flour is much easier. 
    & Letting the dough rest is also key! Apparently it's better to let it rest overnight. Otherwise letting rest for 1 hour is fine. I got my propie crust tips from <a href=\"http://acozykitchen.com/pie-crust-101/\">A cozy kitchen</a>. I'm still new to pie and pie crusts so having resources like that to help out is fantastic.

    & Making brownies has been on my mind for some time i finally settled for spicy brownies with sweet and spicy pomegranate syrup!
    & It took me a LONG time to finally decide on a certain mix of ingredients/flavours. I've had recipe notes lying around on my desktop for a couple of months with ingredients added or scratched off. Nothing was special enough.
    & I would probably still be hesitating on making this dessert if it hadn't been for Devine. His birthday was coming up so I asked him what he wanted as special dessert without hesitation he said \"BROWNIES\".
    & Because i'm still very much a brownie noob I adapted the recipe from Joanne Gallagher's fantastic blog <a href=\"http://www.inspiredtaste.net/24412/cocoa-brownies-recipe/\">Inspired taste</a>. I'm not a good enough cook to just freestyle brownies using her recipe as a base (for quantities especially) helped me out a lot. At least i can get a good idea of how many 'wet' elements I need as well as the right amount of fat and sweet.
    % img/recipes/chili.pomegranate.brownies.1.jpg
    & SO then i needed to make up my mind! Spent time thinking about what i wanted it to look like and how i wanted to present it. Didn't want an extra chocolate topping i've never been a fan of double-chocolate anything. I at least knew i wanted a fruit topping and that I wanted to use a fruit that I haven't yet made recipes with.
    & Originally i wanted to make the brownies in a cake pan to have it 'round' and then to possibly decorate it with powdered sugar patterns using stencils. Then I stumbled upon a recipe online for fish based dish where they used a pomegranate syrup as garnish. Id never made syrup before but i knew that's what i wanted as a 'coulis' over my brownies.
    & I scrapped the round cake pan idea as well as the powdered sugar but i knew that's what i wanted as a 'coulis' over my brownies.
    & I scrapped the round cake pan idea as well as the powdered sugar my brownies were going to be topped with fresh pomegranate seeds and a pomegranate syrup coulis!
    & Again something was missing...
    & I had some really good spicy chocolate fleur de sel cookies last year at the studio where I used to work. The idea of putting chili peppers in cookies or cake had never ocurred to me before. I thought it was absolutely brilliant and the chocolate and chili mix is just *drools*. Lindt makes dark chocolate with chili peppers too I guess it was inspired off of those 2 things.
    % img/recipes/chili.pomegranate.brownies.2.jpg
    & I put a LOT of chili pepper flakes in these haha... i have a higher tolerance to it but if you don't feel free to put less. The syrup has a fair amount in it too if you're worried about the level of spicy you can actually not put it in the brownie batter but just infused in the pomegranate syrup. 
    & These were a big success Devine loved them :)! I cut them into 24 small squares but feel free to make larger blocks. Smaller portions means you can have some longer :D.... i like the idea of that personally!
    & In this recipe I substituted half of the fat for pureed pumpkin. In brownies you can only substitute half the amount
  INST
    - Preheat oven to 325F.
    - Cut 1/3 cup's worth of pumpkin, steam until softened and process into a puree with an immersion blender.
    - Put 3 tbsp ground flax seeds in a bowl with 9 tbsp water, let thicken for 5 minutes. Set aside.
    - Put 5 tbsp of vegan butter, 5 tbsp of pumpkin puree, 3/4 cup whole cane sugar, 3/4 cup cocoa powder and a 1/4 tsp sea salt in a pan over medium to low heat. Stir until the butter is melted and all is well mixed.
    - Stir in the flax 'eggs', as well as the 2 tbsp of red pepper flakes* and 1 tsp cayenne powder. Add 1/2 cup of all purpose flour, mixing vigorously. Mixture should be very thick, but if it doesn't pour easily mix in water 1 tbsp at a time until it's at the right consistency. 
    - Pour into a 8X8 baking dish lined with parchment papper, flatten with the back of a spoon to even it out. Bake for 25 minutes, until toothpick comes out clean. Let cool. Cut in 24 small squares.
    * Syrup
    - Put 2 cups of unsweetened pomegranate juice into a pot with 1 tsp red pepper flakes and 1 tsp cayenne. Bring to a boil, lower to medium-high heat and leave for up to 1h or until liquid has been reduced to 1 cup.
    - Let cool, the syrup will thicken when cooled. Top brownies with fresh pomegranate seeds and drizzle with the chili-infused syrup!

I made some though recently using The simple veganista's <a href=\"http://thesimpleveganista.blogspot.ca/2013/02/banana-french-toastyes-please.html\">Banana french toast</a> recipe thought the idea was brilliant and I do love bananas in my breakfasts SO i decided to try it out! By the way she also has a great 'orange french toast' recipe.
    & Using bananas makes for a more consistent morning meal :>. Most french toast recipes also add nutmeg and cinnamon but honestly I prefer to just taste the fruit sometimes. Also Devine isn't a huge nutmeg fan.
    & The one thing about using black bread for french toast is that it wont 'brown' as easily or at least it isn't as visible. It wont ever get that 'golden' tint.

    & Was in the mood for some panko! Didn't have tofu but what I DID have was a jar full of chickpea flour. Made a batch of spicy green scallion chickpea tofu and coated it with home made bread crumbs to make baked panko chickpea fingers!
    & This dish was inspired off of Vegan Richa's <a href=\"http://www.veganricha.com/2015/03/parmesan-crusted-avocado-kale-florentine-with-smoked-paprika-hollandaise.html\">parmesan crusted avocado</a> recipe I made it just last week!

    & If you don't have any panko just make some yourself! All you need is some left-over bread! I had some i needed to use so i just tore the slices into smaller bits and then put it in my food processor to break it down. Once it was 'crumby' enough I lined a baking sheet with some parchment paper and put the crumbs down in a thin layer for even 'browning'. Preheat your oven at 300F and bake the bread bits for 5 minutes shake them around and then bake them for another 5 minutes.

    & Flautas de coliflor or 'Cauliflower flutes'! Yet another dish of mexican inspiration curried cauliflower wrapped in corn tortillas and draped with an avocado coriander sauce. The flutes are also topped with some roasted thyme pumpkin bits.
    & Typically this type of dish is fried in oil but i figured they would be just as delicious as cold wraps. For a hotter version place in pan with a bit of vegetable oil (canola or corn oil) and fry until browned on both sides. Then just add the sauce and toppings!
    & It's best to steam the tortillas before spooning in the filling to help soften them that way they can be folded easily with no risk of tearing. No one wants torn tortillas (ha-ha).

    & Most people steam the tortillas beforehand with a microwave just put your tortillas in a bag and heat for 30 seconds. Note that I don't have a microwave at home it's an appliance i've never felt the need to own. I've always done well without it. If like me you don't have one you can just use a bit pot with a basket steamer or a colander. It works just fine! Just make sure the water doesn't touch the bottom of your steamer or colander because what you will get are wet tortillas. Much unpleasantness.
    & Made these on a lazy sunday afternoon it's quick and very delicious!

Not sure how people manage to do it guess it takes practice. Maybe it's also because of my roller Devine broke off the handles while overworking pasta dough some time ago. I've been using the 'body' of the roller anyway it still works but it isn't great.

BLACK SESAME ICE CREAM BARS

    & Black sesame ice cream bars because it's starting to get warmer in Montreal! And i want something sweet nutty refreshing and BLACK to eat!
    & Ok so it's not black. Grey is fine though grey is gorgeous. There should be more naturally grey foods.
    & So making crusts is always an ordeal for me most of the time i don't have the ingredients to make it. A lot of recipes call for graham crackers or dates while I do have dates i don't have an endless supply and i don't really want to use a whole cup of it (my wallet doesn't always allow it). Was wondering if there was something i could do with oats i always have a TON of steel cut oats on hand.
    & I looked up recipes for oat-based crusts and found this awesome one by <a href=\"http://www.oatmealwithafork.com/2014/11/14/5-ingredient-no-roll-pie-crust-gluten-free-nut-free/\">Lauren Goslin</a> from 'oatmeal with a fork'. Her recipe called for olive oil but I swapped it out for coconut oil. Coconut oil suits desserts perfectly :)! Assuming you like the taste of coconut because the flavour is pretty strong.
    % img/recipes/black.sesame.ice.cream.bars.2.jpg
    & As for the black sesame ice cream this is actually my 3rd attempt. First one was good made it with silken tofu and coconut milk. Didn't have any silken tofu left for this batch so gave bananas a go and it worked out great! Adds just the right amount of bulk.
    & Being able to make black sesame ice cream at home makes me happy. Now that Japan is so far away and that kombinis aren't 5 minutes away anymore. AH I miss the convenience of Kombinis.

Stir in 4 tbsp of cold water to moisten it further. <small>you can make your own oat flour using steel cut oats by grinding them in a food processor or using an immersion blender.</small>
    - Spoon mixture into 4 mini loaf pans, flatten well with a fork. Bake for 10 minutes. Let cool. <small>I used mini kitchenaid silicone bread pans</small>
    * Ice cream
    - Heat 2/3 cups of black sesame seeds in a pan at medium heat, once they start to pop remove from heat and let cool. Transfer to a food processor and grind into a fine powder.
    - Put in a blender with 1 can of coconut milk, 4 tbsp of sugar and 1 banana. Pulse until smooth.
    - Put pans into a tray, separate batter evenly overtop of the oat crust into the 4 mini pans. <small>The reason i placed them on a tray is so i dont have to handle the silicone bread pans individually, since the mold is soft it means it can 'twist' and cause the batter to spill on the sides of the oat crust. Isn't a big deal but the presentation isn't as pretty if you can't see the two layers</small>
    - Put in the freezer for 3 hours or so. Pop out of the molds and store in another container or eat and enjoy! <small>After spending a long time in the fridge the ice cream part will get pretty hard, you should take it out of the freezer 10 minutes before eating it. It'll be softer and easier to eat that way</small>

So despite today not being a day devoted to cookies I decided to go ahead and make some anyway because yolo.
    % img/recipes/wasabi.swirl.chocolate.cookies.2.jpg
    & I don't know if you guys ever had the wasabi flavoured chocolate that Lindt makes i did for the first time a few years back. I was intrigued by it it's a strange idea especially if you're used to have wasabi with sushi. Wasabi mixed into anything else just feels like it wouldn't work. Like why would anyone want that in a dessert? Goes to show that sometimes it's a good idea to play around with flavours mixing tastes you like together will not always yield good results but in this case it did.
    & I wanted to mix the wasabi directly in the cookies at first but after reading a lot about baking with it I decided to just apply it after in the form of a glaze. People were saying that the taste 'fades' significantly when heated didn't want that! Wanted a wasabi punch-in-the-face taste.

    & Simple black burger buns with white sesame seeds ready in under 1 hour! Made with bamboo charcoal powder.
    & The original recipe I have for <a href=\"http://grimgrains.com/dark+kimchi+burger\">Black burger bun-style bread</a> is good and it makes great bread but it takes a LONG time to prepare. There are days when I don't want to wait 3h for my bread to be ready which was the case yesterday when I decided to make these. Devine's sister was coming over for supper and I had a lot of work to do that morning. Didn't want to spend the entire day running between my computer and the kitchen. Making bread doesn't require a lot of active time but id still need to check often and sometimes that's just enough to take all of my focus away.
    & SO to minimize that I made a quick savoury bread! The same one I made on Valentine's day that had a smoked paprika heart in the center (yes i know so cute. Paprika love). That recipe was based off culinaire amoula's <a href=\"http://www.culinaireamoula.com/article-pain-au-cumin-et-paprika-118254678.html\">Cumin and paprika savoury bread</a>. I simplified the recipe removing the spices and divided it into 5 buns instead of two large loaves. I recommend trying out her recipe as well it's so good... you can have the bread alone with green tea :).

    & I don't have a lot of experience with quick breads im experimenting a lot though to see what i can make in less time. Culinaire amoula's recipe helped me a lot didnt think i could get bread that tasted this good so quickly. It makes great burger buns! The bottom stays flat so in the end you're not stuck with this weird 'ball bread' my last burger was like that and it made it hard to have it sit nicely on a plate. No one wants to eat spherical burgers... actually I take it back that sounds cool. Not practical though.

    - Put 1 tsp of sugar in 1/2 cup of warm water, let it dissolve. Sprinkle 1 tsp of active dry yeast over the water and let it stand for 10 min.
    - Mix 1 1/2 cups of all purpose flour, 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour, 1 tsp of bamboo charcoal powder, 3 tbsp of sesame oil and a pinch of salt. 
    - Pour wet into dry ingredients, knead into a smooth dough. Add more water as needed add 1 tbsp of water at a time
    - Separate dough into 5 equal balls and let rest for 10 minutes, flatten down each ball into discs. Cover with a clean cloth and let rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. 
    - Preheat oven to 350F . Brush the top of the burger breads with a bit of water, sprinkle some white sesame seeds on top pressing down gently to make sure they stick. 
    - Bake for 20 minutes, optionally while they're still hot you can brush the top and sides of the buns with a bit of coconut oil to make the bread softer. Once the buns are cool, cut in two and serve with your choice of patty!

    & Fancy it up with some easy-to-prepare mango ice cream and black sesame syrup! Made using only 4 ingredients. For colour enthusiasts!
    & Internet is full of recipes using just fruit for ice cream yep this recipe is one of 'those'. I've made ice cream with other bases like banana or coconut milk both are good dairy alternatives. Full fat coconut milk is a bit expensive unfortunately so i don't use it too often. You need it to be full fat otherwise it wont freeze well i learned it the hard way. While i do like using those just 1 fruit is nice because of how little preparation is required. Whether you're using bananas watermelon strawberries... all you need to do is cut the fruit up into chunks and freeze it for a few hours. Depending on the fruit it may take longer. Also if like me you don't have a food processor you can cut it up into smaller chunks to make it easier to break down with an immersion blender. 
    % img/recipes/mango.ice.cream.with.black.sesame.syrup.1.jpg
    & I like making syrups or juice reductions a lot it's simple and you can use it in many other recipes afterwards! For reductions that aren't sweetened with sugar you can use as add-on to sauces or alone as a 'glaze'. My fridge has 3 different syrups in it right now you can use as add-on to sauces or alone as a 'glaze'. My fridge has 3 different syrups in it right now "What are those?"" Devine would ask "EXPERIMENTS" I replied creepily "You shall seee...oh yes oh yes... YES. You shall seeee".
    & I used a technique that Mike Case came up with on his blog <a href=\"https://discoginferno.wordpress.com/tag/sesame-seed-syrup/\">Disco Ginferno</a> he made a white sesame syrup to use in cocktails! I liked not requiring a blender to make it blending sesame seeds into a smooth liquid is hard. My immersion blender can't grind seeds finely. Boiling the seeds and then straining them out is simple and since you can re-use the seeds afterwards there's no waste! The fact the seeds are toasted beforehand helps to bring out the nutty flavour so whatever you do don't skip that step!

    - Peel and cut 1 ripe mango into chunks, lay pieces over a plate lined with parchment paper. Put in the freezer for at least 2h. <small>I put parchment paper because sometimes the fruit will stick too much to the plate and is hard to remove</small> 
    - Put 1 cup of black sesame seeds in a pan, bring to medium heat and toast them until they start to pop.
    - In a pot combine 1 cup of water with the black sesame seeds. Bring to a boil and let simmer for 10-15 minutes.
    - Strain liquid from sesame seeds using a cheese cloth or with a mesh strainer, squeezing out as much liquid as you can. Reserve sesame seeds for later use. Return liquid to pot, add 1/2 cup of sugar and bring to medium heat. Stir to dissolve the sugar. Remove from heat and let cool. 
    - Puree frozen mango using an immersion blender, separate in 2 bowls and serve with 2 tbsp of black sesame syrup and some black sesame seeds reserved from before. <small>Keep the sesame seeds! They're still good, you can use them in other dishes</small>

    & Summers in Montreal go hand in hand with beer there is such a wide variety of brews here. My corner store has a TON most are made locally too. Me and Devine like craft beer a lot hard to not drink everyday. To help satisfy our evergrowing craving I decided to try and make hop flavoured ice cream!
    & Sweet and bitter! SUPER TASTY! Felt like I used just the right amount. This ice cream is definitely for people who love the smell and taste of hops (as well as cold summer dairy-free treats)!
    % img/recipes/hop.ice.cream.2.jpg
    & I wasn't sure how to 'infuse' the hops into the ice cream base we tried making hop tea by infusing it overnight in the fridge but the taste wasn't strong enough. Felt we would get better results and better flavour if the hops were heated. The pouch method worked pretty well the ice cream base was perfect! Full of delicious bitterness! Devine suggested to make a concentrate with the hops first and then mix it into the base next time. Another experiment! We tried another batch of hop tea a few days after adding twice as many hops and it ended up tasting too strong. We'll stick to warm infusions for now. 
    & The hops used in this recipe are an American variety called "Colombus". We got them from <a href=\"http://www.choppeabarrock.com\">La choppe a Barrock</a> on Villeneuve et Coloniale every time we make homebrews we pick up the ingredients there! You can buy a wide variety of hop buds there you can even get the pellet kind.
    % img/recipes/hop.ice.cream.3.jpg
    & It was my second time using the ice cream maker I got it from the "Free stuff Montreal" group on facebook. It looks like a little red pail super cute. The woman I got it from even had the manual! You can make ice cream without a machine although having one helps with the 'churning' process. It saves a lot of time and effort. If i hadn't gotten that ice cream maker for free i dont think id have one but since it's here might as well use it!
    & This recipe wouldn't have happened without the instructions from <a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-vegan-ice-cream-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-204755\">The Kitchn</a>. Their vegan ice cream tutorial was super helpful. They have a ton of images on their site too so if you're more of a 'visual' cook you should check it out!
    & If you too are having too many beers these days try and cook with hops instead :P... same taste (ish?) different format!
    ? -Rekka
  INST
    - Roughly chop 7 hop buds (may want to use less if you want it less hoppy). Place leaves into the center of a cheese cloth and make a little loose pouch with it, tying the end. Reserve for later.
    - Shake your 2 cans of coconut milk before opening them, full-fat coconut milk separates over time and shaking will help to mix it up again. Reserve 1/2 a cup of coconut milk for later, put the rest in a pan with 1/2 cup of maple syrup and 1/4 tsp of sea salt. Bring up to medium-low heat, stir until the maple syrup has dissolved completely.
    - Stir 1 1/2 tbsp of cornstarch into the 1/2 cup of coconut milk that was set aside, when dissolved pour into the pan with the rest of the coconut milk while whisking slowly. Increase the heat to medium and add your hop pouch! Let the mixture cook for about 8 minutes, don't let it come to a boil. Reduce the heat if necessary. Move the pouch around once in a while, pinching it down lightly with a wooden spoon to get some of that nice hop flavour out into your ice cream base.
    - Remove from heat, stir in 1 tsp of vanilla extract. Leave it to cool, don't remove the hop pouch!
    - When cool, take the pouch out and squeeze out all of the 'hop juice' into the pan using your hands. Mix one last time and pour into a container. Place a sheet of parchment paper over the top so you don't get a 'skin' forming on the surface. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours (or overnight!).
    - Pull your ice cream out of the fridge, it should have a thick pudding-like texture. Pour into your ice cream maker and churn it to desired consistency (i let it run for ~23 minutes). If you don't have an ice cream maker, please refer to any these 6 methods from the Kitchn - <a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-ice-cream-without-an-ice-cream-machine-171060\">'6 ways to make ice cream without an ice cream machine'</a>.
    - Transfer to a container and press a sheet of parchment paper over the top to keep ice crystals from forming. Your ice cream should be ready to eat in 5 hours or so! If you want harder ice cream wait until the next day to eat it. Enjoy!

SUNFLOWER HEIRLOOM CARROT PASTA

    & Using veggies as noodles in a dish is something I really enjoy doing; it tastes fresh and is ready in a second! Thank you julienne peeler your precense in my kitchen has made the process of cutting vegetables in thin strips enjoyable. Spending the greater part of an evening cutting daikon or cucumbers thinly by hand are now thankfully nothing but a distant memory. Brought home a bag full of beautiful heirloom carrots from Jean-Talon market last weekend. I've been using them in meals all week - Carrot ginger soup sour pickled carrots baked in a lentil loaf etc. Heirloom carrots come in a wide variety of colours; the yellow ones I thought resembled pasta. Thus came the idea for heirloom carrot pasta! 
    & I used yellow and red carrots for this recipe; love how these veggies are coloured all the way down to the core. Zucchinis make great pasta noodles but the white interior makes for a dull-looking meal. It looks especially beautiful with a sunflower "cheese" sauce. As you know I'm allergic to tree nuts but the white interior makes for a dull-looking meal. It looks especially beautiful with a sunflower "cheese" sauce. As you know I'm allergic to tree nuts so my vegan cheese alternatives are somewhat limited. Luckily I can have seeds which can be used interchangeably with nuts in most pasta sauce recipes. It produces a similar result just as creamy and just as nutritious!
    & Until recently I didn't know why you had to soak seeds and nuts before eating them. As it turns out they have their own personal defense mechanisms - nutritional inhibitors and toxic substances. Ingesting seeds or nuts without soaking makes it harder to digest you're also missing out on a ton of nutritional benefits. The last time I made this recipe I tried the quick boiling method it is easier to grind down into a sauce but it will still be hard on your digestive system. My stomach groaned for hours after that meal I personally prefer to soak the seeds overnight.
    & The idea for a sunflower seed sauce came from <a href=\"http://www.vegansandra.com/2014/10/sunflower-seeds-are-new-cashews.html\">Vegan Sandra</a> in her post she talks about how sunflower seeds are the new cashews and provides a recipe that I used as a base for my carrot pasta. While I loved her recipe.

    - Dissolve 1/2 tsp of sea salt in 1/2 cup of water. Add sunflower seeds, cover with a breathable material and leave to soak overnight or for at least 8 hours. <small>Alternatively, you can pour boiling water over the seeds and let them soak for 10 minutes. This method is quicker but it will be less nutritious</small>
    - Sautee 1 chopped yellow onion and 2 garlic cloves in a pan with a tsp of olive oil. Cook until onion is translucent.
    - Rinse the sunflower seeds, and puree in a blender with the cooked garlic and onion, 1 tbsp soy sauce (or tamari), 1/2 tsp of smoked paprika, 1 heaping tsp of white miso, 1 tbsp nutritional yeast and 1/2 cup of water. Blend until smooth.
    - Peel and cut 4 large heirloom carrots into thin strips, using a julienne peeler or spiralizer will make your life a lot easier. The goal is to make pasta-like strips.
    - Add a bit of water to a pot, bring to a boil. Place steamer basket in the pot, cover and steam the carrots for a minute. <small>You don't have to steam your carrots, but personally I like to do it so they're not as stiff. Depending on the thickness of your carrots you may need more or less.</small>
    - Divide carrot pasta in 2 bowls, pour sauce overtop and serve with some fresh alfalfa sprouts or with a handful of <a href=\"http://grimgrains.com/roasted+pumpkin+seeds\">roasted pumpkin seeds</a>!

CARROT KINPIRA ONIGIRAZU

    & Even if I don't live in Tokyo anymore I try and keep up with what's happening over there. I still follow the news and try totranslate some simple texts to see how many kanji i've forgotten. My favourite kanji is the one for bone "骨" (pronounced 'ho-ne'). I also love the kanji combination for jellyfish or "水母" (pronounced 'ku-ra-ge') which beautifully translates to water mother. These two words come together to create this expression "水母の骨" or "jellyfish bones". It is used when talking about something that you would not expect to exist like bones in a jellyfish. I could go on but seeing as how this has nothing to with food here goes - The recipe i'm sharing with you today is japanese inspired and is also currently part of a craze over there. I made some onigirazu a sort of hybrid japanese rice ball sandwich.
    % img/recipes/carrot.kinpira.onigirazu.1.jpg
    & The word onigiri ('nigiru') means to press into shape using your hands while "razu" means the opposite; free form onigiri! This is perfect for people who have a hard time making rice balls as is the case for me. Onigirazu has the same great taste without the fear of imperfection; all the shame is hidden away under a blanket of nori and fillings.
    & The concept of this rice sandwich is perfect when you don't have the right type of rice available for onigiri. You can use just about any type of rice i tested it out with some Minute Rice and it worked perfectly. I was given some coupons to try out their products i'm all for experimentation so i picked up a box of whole grain brown Minute Rice. It was my fist time trying it generally purchase rice in bulk because it's cheaper and has a lot less packaging but after cooking with it i do see the appeal. The rice is 'parboiled' which means that you wont have to wait very long for your meal to be ready your rice will be cooked in 1/4 of the time it takes for traditional brown rice. As you all know sticky rice takes a long time to cook your rice will be cooked in 1/4 of the time it takes for traditional brown rice. As you all know sticky rice takes a long time to cook I don't mind having to wait after my rice but I know that not everyone has that luxury. It's a good thing that this option exists it means it's even easier to cook great meals rapidly at home.
    % img/recipes/carrot.kinpira.onigirazu.2.jpg
    & The rice was seasoned with miso for added flavour and was filled with carrot kinpira. Kinpira means "sauteed"; usually with a mixture of mirin soy sauce and chili peppers. It's a sweet and spicy dish that is often served in bentos. I knew I wanted this as a filling for my onigirazu; to satisfy my sudden craving for japanese food. This would have been amazing with gobo but finding the root here in Montreal is no easy task.
    % img/recipes/carrot.kinpira.onigirazu.3.jpg
    & You should try and make your own version of onigirazu at home! As i said it's no-fail and with some parboiled rice it can ready in under 20 minutes (you can also parboil your own rice). I may not live near a 24h kombini with readily available onigiri anymore but i know i can make some at home easily and quickly.
    & Minute rice gave me a few extra coupons to give away. The first 4 people to like and share the recipe on facebook will be given a coupon exchangable for any size box and any variety Minute rice products (must live in Canada to be elligible). Visit the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/grimgrains\">Facebook page</a> for your chance to win. I'll also be sending a custom grim grains style drawing along with it.
  INST
    * Kinpira carrot
    - Peel and cut 1 large carrot into thin strips.
    - Stir these ingredients together to make the sauce for the kinpira - 1 teaspoon of maple syrup, 1 teaspoon of mirin and 2 teaspons of soy sauce.
    - Heat 1 teaspoon of sesame oil in a pan at medium heat, add the carrot strips and cook for 2-3 minutes. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon of chili pepper flakes as well as the sauce prepared in the previous step. Cook until no liquid remains. Let cool.
    * Rice
    - Dissolve 1 tbsp of white miso in 1 cup of water and pour into pot with 1 cup of parboiled whole grain brown rice (I used Minute rice). Bring to a boil; once it starts to bubble up lower to a simmer, cover and cook for 5-10 minutes or until all of the liquid has been absorbed. 
    * Combine
    - Lay out 2 pieces of nori sheets, rough side up. Divide half of the rice in the middle of the 2 sheets, then divide the carrot kinpira into 2 portions and lay over the rice. Cover the carrots with the remaining rice.
    - Now take one corner of the nori sheet and fold over into the middle, do the same for the opposing corner. Then repeat for the other 2 corners; press down gently. Wait until the nori has softened and then cut into the middle!

    & When it comes to plant-based cold desserts Montreal has a lot of options. The places I tried are all within walking distance because generally when I want ice cream i don't want to have to go far to get it. Luckily the 2 places that are near my home offer dairy-free options though often this means sorbet. While I like sorbet the flavours are rarely as creative as milk-based ice creams. When i don't want sorbet I just make my own ice cream at home. I have many other ice cream recipes on this blog but some of them require a bit more waiting time and effort which admittedly I don't always care for. Banana ice cream to the rescue! A delicious and simple alternative to dairy or coconut based desserts.
    % img/recipes/balsamic.banana.ice.cream.1.jpg
    & I was introduced to vanilla ice cream with a balsamic vinegar coulis at my friend Lisa's small Shimokitazawa appartment. It was summer; we wanted to cool out insides. Tokyo summers are unbearably warm. I can't say I remember where I got the idea to put balsamic vinegar on ice cream it might have been in a magazine or restaurant. That evening it came to mind and we tested it out and it was fantastic! Not things i thought could go well together.

    & I remembered that night today and desperarely wanted to re-create a dairy-free version of it. Lots of blogs i love have also been making banana-based recipes and desperarely wanted to re-create a dairy-free version of it. Lots of blogs i love have also been making banana-based recipes i first saw a recipe on the whole foods website for it. Making it is incredibly easy; you just put bananas in the freezer. While you wait for them to harden up you can prepare your balsamic coulis and make your appartment smell of vinegar. If you've ever boiled balsamic vinegar you know what i'm talking about; it smells wonderful but it hurts your face a lot. I didn't want to pour the vinegar straight from the bottle over the ice cream making a reduction makes it more 'syrupy' and it just works better as a topping.
    & I don't have a powerful blender or food processor at home so reducing the 2 frozen banana chunks to a smooth puree was difficult. It took longer than i thought it would and because of that my ice cream was melting when the time came to take photos. So pro-tip, don't use an immersion blender. If you're desperate and/or reckless and want to try it anyways do it in batches.

    * Balsamic reduction
    - Put 1 cup of balsamic vinegar in a non-stick pan. Bring up to medium high heat, once it starts to boil bring down to medium low and let simmer until the vinegar has been reduced by a little more than half. Stir it on occasion <small>Make sure you have an open window or the overhead fan running because boiling vinegar has a really strong smell</small>
    - Transfer to a bowl and let cool completely, then store in the refrigerator.

    & This time last year Grim Grains was born. If you were there at the start of it all you'll remember that the first recipe I posted was black scones (my lovely eatable meteorites). Cooking had become a passion this blog needed to happen. I was freelancing back then and had a lot of time to dedicate to the project nowadays I work in studio all day and finding time to cook up new foods is tough. Because of this my meals have become simpler. I feel my meals will continue to be simple due to the fact that me and Devine will be embarking on an exciting new adventure next year- We want to live on a sailboat. If you've ever been on one you know that space is an issue. I'm not only talking about storage but also about refrigeration. Grim Grains will still happen but will be very different at this point I imagine. Hopefully i'll still be able to make my own pâté; my definition of a simple and practical food!
    & I wanted to try and re-create a curry pâté I had some time ago while I didn't have sunflower seeds to use as a base I had a jar full of pumpkin seeds! As you know pumpkin seeds can be expensive I recommend buying it in bulk (I ordered mine from Yupik.com). As with my veggie pate recipe the seeds need to be soaked prior to blending. To learn more about the whys and hows of seed soaking check out the article <a href=\"http://healthyblenderrecipes.com/info/soaking_grains_nuts_seeds\">Soaking Nuts Seeds & Grains</a> by the Blender Girl.

    - Strain and rinse off the pumpkin seeds. Put in a large bowl with 1/2 cup of ground rolled oats (you can grind the oats into a flour with an immersion blender), 2 grated carrots, 2 minced garlic cloves, a 1/3 cup of steamed sweet potatoes, the chopped scallions, 1 tsp of lemon juice, 2 tsp of curry powder, 1 tsp of garam masala, 1/2 tsp of turmeric powder and 1/3 cup of water. Puree with an immersion blender or using a food processor.

    & Summer is over temperature in Montreal started to dip into the lower 20's. Colder times means collecting the remaining fresh herbs from my balcony garden.

My basil plant was a real beauty I harvested all I could from it and made pesto and with the pesto I made this recipe—the perfect way to end the summer.

    & Cadbury released a vegemite chocolate bar earlier this year as usual I only found out about it this week. I liked the idea so much I decided to make something inspired from it. Ended up making some vegemite caramel.
    & I currently have two vegemite jars our friend shipped them to us last year. It's delicious but I don't always know what to make with it. It's great on toast but aside from that...
    % img/recipes/vegemite.caramel.1.jpg
    & The vegemite caramel mix of the Cadbury bar intrigued me. Vegemite is quite salty but I happen to be a big fan of salted sweets – I'm looking at you sea salt chocolate. If I added some to date caramel (instead of salt) I knew it would taste good. I have Alissa from <a href=\"http://www.nourishingmeals.com/2010/09/raw-caramel-dip-for-apples.html\">Nourishing meals</a> to thank for the idea of date caramel. I used deglet noor dates for this recipe because it's what I had feel free to use medjool dates instead. Medjool dates are great but you don't have to use them they're expensive and their cheaper counterparts work just fine.
    & I was right it tastes amazing. Cut a few apples up and dip them right into the vegemite caramel or you can spread it over some toast! This is a weird mix but believe me it tastes awesome.

Those recipes weren't holiday-specific but these cute pumpkin cookies sure are! They're super soft and easy to prepare.
    & Been a while since i've baked cookies.
    & I felt like making sweets and since it's pumpkin season I decided to get one and make something with it.
    % img/recipes/halloween.pumpkin.cookies.2.jpg
    & I like these a lot because they're not too sweet I have coconut sugar to thank for that. It has a more complex taste caramel-like. I would suggest using that if you have it if you don't you can substitute it with any other sugar. Coconut sugar will make your cookies a darker shade of orange almost brown. I think it fits nicely with the toned-down colour of the pumpkin seeds. If you want a bold orange colour use white cane sugar instead (or another type of white sugar).
    & I'm going to a themed halloween party this year don't think these will fit with it. I'll be eating these all week instead!

    * Cookie dough
    - Preheat oven to 350F .
    - Steam 1/2 cup's worth of pumpkin cubes. Set aside to cool. 
    - Stir 1/2 cup of all purpose flour, 1/2 cup of spelt flour and 1/2 tsp of baking powder together in a bowl.
    - Put the steamed pumpkin, the 4 tbsp of melted vegan butter as well as the 1/2 cup of coconut sugar in another bowl. Mash the pumpkin with a fork (or use a hand blender) and stir everything together until smooth and well mixed.
    - Add the wet to the dry ingredients, mix with a wooden spoon until you get a soft and consistent dough. It will be sticky but that's fine, if it's too sticky feel free to add a bit of extra flour. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes.
    - Line a baking sheet with a silpat (or parchment paper). Make little balls of dough, as round as you can make them, and flatten each one gently. Bake for 15 minutes.
    - Decorate each cookie with 3 pumpkin seeds, sticking them at the top (pointy end in).
    * Chocolate
    - Mix 1/4 cup of coconut oil, 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, 1/4 tsp vanilla, 2 tbsp maple syrup and a pinch of salt together in a glass bowl. 
    - Put a bit of water to boil in a pot (large enough to fit your bowl, or to have it hanging overtop).
    - Lower the heat to a simmer, add the glass bowl with the chocolate into the pot, stir with a spoon until the chocolate is smooth and runny. 
    - Remove from heat.
    - Take a toothpick and dip into the chocolate, draw pumpkin faces on your cookies and serve as is!\
    * Extra chocolate treat
    - As for the rest of your chocolate mixture, pour it in a chocolate mold or shallow container and put it in the freezer. It will become solid and you'll have delicious homemade chocolate on the side for later times! Once it's solid, pop it out of the mold and put it in a closed container. Keep it in the freezer until you're ready to eat it!

    - While the peppers are roasting, cut 1 yellow onion into thin slices. Place your pan over medium heat and melt 1 tbsp of vegan butter, when melted, add the onion and stir gently to coat with butter. Cook for 5 minutes, add 1 minced garlic clove and 1/2 tsp of ground dried rosemary. Cook for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the onions are caramelized.

    & Got up early sunday morning with cookies on my mind. When I peeked into my fridge I spotted a lonely jar of leftover date caramel. It was then that I decided to make some salted caramel cookies with unsweetened carob chips! 
    & The kind people at <a href=\"http://www.daybreakmill.com\">Daybreak Mill</a> sent me a bag of einkorn flour last week i'd never heard of it before. After researching I learned that einkorn wheat is pretty damn great! It's quite nutritious einkorn is one of the first domesticated and cultivated plants. It has a higher percentage of protein than regular wheat with high levels of fat phosphorus potassium pyridoxine (a form of vitamin b6) and beta-carotene.   Another great thing about it is that it isn't as toxic to people on gluten-free diets. This wasn't proved but it's worth looking into!
    % img/recipes/salted.caramel.carob.chip.cookies.1.jpg
    & I tried baking bread with it this week it did not rise all that well. While it is a dense loaf it did not rise all that well. While it is a dense loaf the texture is quite nice! It has a strong nutty taste making it more flavourful than regular wheat. Einkorn bread is filling I don't think i would use it to make a sandwich but it makes nice breakfast toast.
    & After my bread experiment I decided to try and make something sweet. The dates coconut sugar and carob chips create a strong caramel taste; the fleur de sel sprinkled overtop brings out the flavour nicely.
    & I can't thank Daybreak mill enough for sending me this gift and for introducing me to einkorn flour! Their products are organic and made with the utmost care. You can get your own einkorn flour from their website they also have a ton of other great products. Encouraging companies that share your outlook on food and life is important.

    - In a large bowl, mix 1 cup + 3 tbsp of einkorn flour with 3/4 tsp baking soda and 1/4 tsp of salt.
    - Melt 1/4 cup of vegan butter and in a separate bowl, cream with 3/4 of coconut sugar, a 1/4 cup of date caramel and the flax egg. Then add to the dry ingredients and mix well. Add 1/2 cup of unsweetened carob chips and stir until evenly distributed.
    - Line a baking sheet with parchment paper (or with a silpat if you have one) and scoop out tablespoon-sized portions of cookie dough. Roll them out with your hands and place them on the baking sheet, making sure there's enough space between each one. Sprinkle some fleur de sel on top and bake for 10 minutes, repeat until you run out of cookie dough. Let cool on baking sheet before transfering to a cooling rack. Makes about 20 cookies.

    & After Japan opened itself to the world over a hundred years ago japanese cooks began to adapt western dishes in their own style. For instance in the west people use ketchup as a condiment but the japanese use it as a base for tomato sauces in 'Naporitan' pasta. Spaghetti 'Naporitan' was created just after world war 2 after Shigetada (the head chef at the Hotel New Grand in Yokohama) saw occupying soldiers eating it. Nowadays you can find spaghetti seasoned with soy sauce and served with seaweed. I have always been a huge fan of japanese-style pasta and decided to make my own version!
