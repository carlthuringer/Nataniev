OQUONIE
  BREF : We started {*Grim Grains*} once we realized food could be artistically fulfilling. Cooking became an creative output, while the blog allowed us to document our progress and keep track of the things we made. The blog is about being artistically creative with food and colour. Colours for added nutrition, for contrast and for visual harmony. Most of my recipes are also nut-free and plant-based.
