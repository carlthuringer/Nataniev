Fallacies
  Bandwagon fallacy
    DEF : Concluding that an idea has merit simply because many people believe it or practice it. 
    EX1 : Most people believe in a god; therefore, it must prove true.
  Conjunction fallacy
    DEF : Assuming that specific conditions are more probable than general ones.
  Detached lever fallacy
    DEF : Assuming that something simple for one system will be simple for others. 
    EX1 : 
  Gambler's fallacy
    DEF : Assuming that individual random events are influenced by previous random events.
    EX1 : I've flipped heads with this coin five times consecutively, so the chance of tails coming out on the sixth flip is much greater than heads.
  Ludic fallacy
    DEF : Analysing chance related problems within the narrow frame of games. 
  Mind projection fallacy
    DEF : Thinking that the way you see the world reflects the way the world really is.
  Planning fallacy
    DEF : Underestimating task-completion times.
  Sunk cost fallacy
    DEF : Letting past investments interfere with decision-making in the present.
  Typical mind fallacy
    DEF : Assuming that other people are more like you than they actually are.
  Composition fallacy
    DEF : when the conclusion of an argument depends on an erroneous characteristic from parts of something to the whole or vice versa.
    EX1 : Humans have consciousness and human bodies and brains consist of atoms; therefore, atoms have consciousness.
    EX2 : a word processor program consists of many bytes; therefore a byte forms a fraction of a word processor.
  Giant cheesecake fallacy
    DEF : Occurs when an argument leaps directly from capability to actuality, without considering the necessary intermediate of motive.
    EX1 : A sufficiently powerful Artificial Intelligence could overwhelm any human resistance and wipe out humanity.
  Narrative fallacy

  Noncentral fallacy
    DEF : A rhetorical move often used in political, philosophical, and cultural arguments.
    EX1 : X is in a category whose archetypal member gives us a certain emotional reaction. Therefore, we should apply that emotional reaction to X, even though it is not a central category member.
  Reification fallacy
    EX1 : IQ tests as an actual measure of intelligence; the concept of race (even though genetic attributes exist), from the chosen combination of attributes or the labeling of a group of people, come from abstract social constructs; 
    EX2 : Astrology; god(s); Jesus; Santa Claus, black race, white race, etc.
  Scales of justice fallacy
    DEF : Error of using a simple polarized scheme for deciding a complex issue/ each piece of evidence about the question is individually categorized as supporting exactly one of the two opposing positions.
  Texas sharpshooter fallacy
    DEF : Adjusting an hypothesis after the data was collected.
  The top 1% fallacy
    DEF : Related to not taking into account the idea that a small sample size is not always reflective of a whole population and that sample populations with certain characteristics, e.g. made up of repeat job seekers, are not reflective of the whole population.

Heuristics
  Absurdity heuristic
    DEF : Mental shortcut where highly untypical situations are classified as absurd or impossible. Where you don't expect intuition to construct an adequate model of reality, classifying an idea as impossible may be overconfident.
  Affect heuristic
    DEF : Mental shortcut that makes use of current emotions to make decisions and solve problems quickly and efficiently. basing a decision on an emotional reaction rather than a calculation of risks and benefits.
  Availability heuristic
    DEF : Mental shortcut that treats easily recalled information as important or at least more important than alternative solutions which are not as readily recalled. a biased prediction, due to the tendency to focus on the most salient and emotionally-charged outcome.
  Contagion heuristic
    DEF : Leads people to avoid contact with people or objects viewed as "contaminated" by previous contact with someone or something viewed as bad-or, less often, to seek contact with objects that have been in contact with people or things considered good.
  Representativeness heuristic
    DEF : Mental shortcut where people judge the probability or frequency of a hypothesis by considering how much the hypothesis resembles available data as opposed to using a Bayesian calculation.

Arguments
  Arguing by analogy
    DEF : Arguing that since things are alike in some ways, they will probably be alike in others. 
  Arguing by definition
    DEF : Arguing that something is part of a class because it fits the definition of that class. 
  Argument from omniscience
    DEF : An arguer would need omniscience to know about everyone's beliefs or disbeliefs or about their knowledge.
    EX1 : All people believe in something. Everyone knows that.
  Argumentum ad baculum
    DEF : Argument relying on an appeal to fear or a threat.
    EX1 : If you don't believe in God, you'll burn in hell

    ENG : argument from authority.
    EX1 : Professor so-and-so believes in creation-science.
  Argumentum ex silentio
    DEF : Argument relyingon ignorance as evidence for something.
    ENG : Appeal to ignorance
    EX1 : We have no evidence that God doesn't exist, therefore, he must exist.
    EX2 : Because we have no knowledge of alien visitors, that means they do not exist.
  Argumentum ad consequentiam
    DEF : An argument that concludes a premise as either true or false based on whether the premise leads to desirable or undesirable consequences.
    ENG : Appeal to consequences
    EX1 : Some religious people believe that knowledge of evolution leads to immorality, therefore evolution proves false. Even if teaching evolution did lead to immorality, it would not imply a falsehood of evolution.
  Straw man
    DEF : Creating a false or made up scenario and then attacking it. Painting your opponent with false colors only deflects the purpose of the argument.
    EX1 : Evolutionists think that everything came about by random chance. 
  Steel man
    DEF : Opposite of strawman. To steelman is to address the strongest possible variant or the most charitable interpretation of an idea, rather than the most available phrasings. Steelmanning can be especially important when the network by which phrasings are brought to your attention has a preference for propagating uncharitable/controversial phrasings.
  Fully general counterargument
    DEF : An argument which can be used to discount any conclusion the arguer does not like. Being in possession of such an argument leads to irrationality because it allows the arguer to avoid updating their beliefs.
    EX1 : You're just saying that because you're exhibiting X bias.
  Applause light
    DEF : Is an empty statement which evokes positive affect without providing new information
  Argument from adverse consequences
    DEF : Just because a repugnant crime or act occurred, does not necessarily mean that a defendant committed the crime or that we should judge him guilty. Or, disasters occur because God punishes non-believers; therefore, we should all believe in God) Just because calamities or tragedies occur, says nothing about the existence of gods or that we should believe in a certain way.
    EX1 : We should judge the accused as guilty, otherwise others will commit similar crimes
  Proving non-existence
    DEF : When an arguer cannot provide the evidence for his claims, he may challenge his opponent to prove it doesn't exist. Although one may prove non-existence in special limitations, such as showing that a box does not contain certain items, one cannot prove universal or absolute non-existence, or non-existence out of ignorance. One cannot prove something that does not exist. The proof of existence must come from those who make the claims.
    EX1 : prove God doesn't exist; prove UFO's haven't visited earth, etc.
  Ad hominem
    DEF : An arguer who uses ad hominems attacks the person instead of the argument. Whenever an arguer cannot defend his position with evidence, facts or reason.
    EX1 : labeling, straw man arguments, name calling, offensive remarks and anger.
    ENG : to the man
  Red herring
    DEF : A diversion from the active topic.

  Testing effect
    DEF : The fact that you more easily remember information you have read by rewriting it instead of rereading it.
  Underconfidence effect
    DEF : State of being more uncertain than is justified, given your priors and the evidence you are aware of.
  Verbatim effect
    DEF : That the "gist" of what someone has said is better remembered than the verbatim wording. This is because memories are representations, not exact copies.

  Omission bias
    DEF : Tendency to judge harmful actions as worse, or less moral, than equally harmful omissions.
  Self-serving bias
    DEF : Tendency to attribute successes to internal characteristics while blaming failures on outside forces. It may also manifest itself as a tendency for people to evaluate ambiguous information in a way beneficial to their interests.
  Shared information bias
    DEF : Tendency for group members to spend more time and energy discussing information that all members are already familiar with (i.e., shared information), and less time and energy discussing information that only some members are aware of.
    EX1 : unshared information

Rationality
  Bounded rationality
    DEF : limits on optimization and rationality
  Costs of rationality
    DEF : Becoming more epistemically rational can only guarantee one thing/ what you believe will include more of the truth. Knowing that truth might help you achieve your goals, or cause you to become a pariah. Be sure that you really want to know the truth before you commit to finding it; otherwise, you may flinch from it.
  Group rationality
    DEF : In almost anything, individuals are inferior to groups.
  Hollywood rationality
    DEF : What Spock does, not what actual rationalists do.
  Problem of verifying rationality
    DEF : is the single largest problem for those desiring to create methods of systematically training for increased epistemic and instrumental rationality - how to verify that the training actually worked.
  Traditional rationality
    DEF : "Traditional Rationality" refers to the tradition passed down by reading Richard Feynman's "Surely You're Joking", Thomas Kuhn's "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions", Martin Gardner's "Science/ Good, Bad, and Bogus", Karl Popper on falsifiability, or other non-technical material on rationality. Traditional Rationality is a very large improvement over nothing at all, and very different from Hollywood rationality; people who grew up on this belief system are definitely fellow travelers, and where most of our recruits come from. But you can do even better by adding math, science, formal epistemic and instrumental rationality; experimental psychology, cognitive science, deliberate practice, in short, all the technical stuff.There's also some popular tropes of Traditional Rationality that actually seem flawed once you start comparing them to a Bayesian standard -
    EX1 : the idea that you ought to give up an idea once definite evidence has been provided against it, but you're allowed to believe until then, if you want to. Contrast to the stricter idea of there being a certain exact probability which it is correct to assign, continually updated in the light of new evidence.

Theories
  Ambient decision theory
    DEF : A variant of updateless decision theory that uses first order logic instead of mathematical intuition module (MIM), emphasizing the way an agent can control which mathematical structure a fixed definition defines, an aspect of UDT separate from its own emphasis on not making the mistake of updating away things one can still acausally control.
  Causal decision theory
    DEF : a branch of decision theory which advises an agent to take actions that maximizes the causal consequences on the probability of desired outcomes
  Control theory
    EX1 : An example is a cruise control, which maintains a certain speed, but only measures the current speed, and knows nothing of the system that produces that speed (wind, car weight, grade).
  Decision theory
    DEF : Is the study of principles and algorithms for making correct decisions-that is, decisions that allow an agent to achieve better outcomes with respect to its goals.
  Evidential decision theory
    DEF : a branch of decision theory which advises an agent to take actions which, conditional on it happening, maximizes the chances of the desired outcome.
  Game theory
    DEF : attempts to mathematically model interactions between individuals.
  Moral foundations theory
    DEF : care/harm, fairness/cheating, liberty/oppression,loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, sanctity/degradation). This makes other people's moralities easier to understand, and is an interesting lens through which to examine your own.
  Probability theory
    DEF : a field of mathematics which studies random variables and processes.
  Reflective decision theory
    DEF : a term occasionally used to refer to a decision theory that would allow an agent to take actions in a way that does not trigger regret. This regret is conceptualized, according to the Causal Decision Theory, as a Reflective inconsistency, a divergence between the agent who took the action and the same agent reflecting upon it after.
  Timeless decision theory
    DEF : a decision theory, which in slogan form, says that agents should decide as if they are determining the output of the abstract computation that they implement. This theory was developed in response to the view that rationality should be about winning (that is, about agents achieving their desired ends) rather than about behaving in a manner that we would intuitively label as rational.
  Updateless decision theory
    DEF : a decision theory in which we give up the idea of doing Bayesian reasoning to obtain a posterior distribution etc. and instead just choose the action (or more generally, the probability distribution over actions) that will maximize the unconditional expected utility.

Evidence
  Amount of evidence
    DEF : to a Bayesian, evidence is a quantitative concept. The more complicated or a priori improbable a hypothesis is, the more evidence you need just to justify it, or even just single it out of the amongst the mass of competing theories.
  Conservation of expected evidence
    DEF : "for every expectation of evidence, there is an equal and opposite expectation of counterevidence". 0 = (P(H|E)-P(H))\*P(E) + (P(H|~E)-P(H))\*P(~E)
  Extraordinary evidence
    DEF : is evidence that turns an a priori highly unlikely event into an a posteriori likely event.
  Filtered evidence
    DEF : Evidence that was selected for the purpose of proving (disproving) a hypothesis. Filtered evidence may be highly misleading, but can still be useful, if considered with care.
  Generalization from fictional evidence
    DEF : logical fallacy that consists of drawing real-world conclusions based on statements invented and selected for the purpose of writing fiction.
  Rational evidence
    DEF : the broadest possible sense of evidence, the Bayesian sense. Rational evidence about a hypothesis H is any observation which has a different likelihood depending on whether H holds in reality or not. Rational evidence is distinguished from narrower forms of evidence, such as scientific evidence or legal evidence. For a belief to be scientific, you should be able to do repeatable experiments to verify the belief. For evidence to be admissible in court, it must e.g. be a personal observation rather than hearsay.

Belief
  Priors
    DEF : The beliefs an agent holds regarding a fact, hypothesis or consequence, before being presented with evidence.
  Belief in belief
    DEF : Where it is difficult to believe a thing, it is often much easier to believe that you ought to believe it. Were you to really believe and not just believe in belief, the consequences of error would be much more severe. When someone makes up excuses in advance, it would seem to require that belief, and belief in belief, have become unsynchronized.
  Free-floating belief
    DEF : is a belief that both doesn't follow from observations and doesn't restrict which experiences to anticipate. It is both unfounded and useless.
  Improper belief
    DEF : is a belief that isn't concerned with describing the territory.
    EX1 : Note that the fact that a belief just happens to be true doesn't mean you're right to have it. If you buy a lottery ticket, certain that it's a winning ticket (for no reason), and it happens to be, believing that was still a mistake. Types of improper belief discussed in the Mysterious Answers to Mysterious Questions sequence include/ Free-floating belief, Belief as attire, Belief in belief and Belief as cheering
  Proper belief
    DEF : requires observations, gets updated upon encountering new evidence, and provides practical benefit in anticipated experience.
  Belief update
    DEF : what you do to your beliefs, opinions and cognitive structure when new evidence comes along.
  Belief as attire
    DEF : is a example of an improper belief promoted by identification with a group or other signaling concerns, not by how well it reflects the territory.
  Belief as cheering
    DEF : People can bind themselves as a group by believing "crazy" things together. Then among outsiders they could show the same pride in their crazy belief as they would show wearing "crazy" group clothes among outsiders. The belief is more like a banner saying "GO BLUES". It isn't a statement of fact, or an attempt to persuade; it doesn't have to be convincing-it's a cheer.
  Idiosyncrasy credits
    DEF : Each extra weird belief you have detracts from your ability to spread other, perhaps more important, weird memes. Therefore normal beliefs should be preferred to some extent, even when you expect them to be less correct or less locally useful on an issue, in order to improve your overall effectiveness at spreading your most highly valued memes.

Technique
  Shut up and multiply
    DEF : The ability to trust the math even when it feels wrong
  Rationality as martial art
    DEF : A metaphor for rationality as the martial art of mind; training brains in the same fashion as muscles. 
  Making beliefs pay rent
    DEF : Every question of belief should flow from a question of anticipation, and that question of anticipation should be the centre of the inquiry. Every guess of belief should begin by flowing to a specific guess of anticipation, and should continue to pay rent in future anticipations. If a belief turns deadbeat, evict it.
  Debiasing
    DEF : The process of overcoming bias. It takes serious study to gain meaningful benefits, half-hearted attempts may accomplish nothing, and partial knowledge of bias may do more harm than good.
  Epistemic hygiene
    DEF : Consists of practices meant to allow accurate beliefs to spread within a community and keep less accurate or biased beliefs contained. The practices are meant to serve an analogous purpose to normal hygiene and sanitation in containing disease. "Good cognitive citizenship" is another phrase that has been proposed for this concept.
  Third option
    DEF : A way to break a false dilemma, showing that neither of the suggested solutions is a good idea.
  Take joy in the merely real
    DEF : If you believe that science coming to know about something places it into the dull catalogue of common things, then you're going to be disappointed in pretty much everything eventually -either it will turn out not to exist, or even worse, it will turn out to be real. Another way to think about it is that if the magical and mythical were common place they would be merely real. If dragons were common, but zebras were a rare legendary creature then there's a certain sort of person who would ignore dragons, who would never bother to look at dragons, and chase after rumors of zebras. The grass is always greener on the other side of reality. If we cannot take joy in the merely real, our lives shall be empty indeed.
  Something to protect
    DEF : The Art must have a purpose other than itself, or it collapses into infinite recursion.
  Spaced repetition
    DEF : A technique for building long-term knowledge efficiently. It works by showing you a flash card just before a computer model predicts you will have forgotten it. Anki is Less Wrong's spaced repetition software of choice
  Reversal test
    DEF : a technique for fighting status quo bias in judgments about the preferred value of a continuous parameter. If one deems the change of the parameter in one direction to be undesirable, the reversal test is to check that either the change of that parameter in the opposite direction (away from status quo) is deemed desirable, or that there are strong reasons to expect that the current value of the parameter is (at least locally) the optimal one.
  Radical honesty
    DEF : a communication technique proposed by Brad Blanton in which discussion partners are not permitted to lie or deceive at all. Rather than being designed to enhance group epistemic rationality, radical honesty is designed to reduce stress and remove the layers of deceit that burden much of discourse.
  Rationalist taboo
    DEF : a technique for fighting muddles in discussions. By prohibiting the use of a certain word and all the words synonymous to it, people are forced to elucidate the specific contextual meaning they want to express, thus removing ambiguity otherwise present in a single word. Mainstream philosophy has a parallel procedure called "unpacking" where doubtful terms need to be expanded out.
  Outside view
    DEF : Taking the outside view (another name for reference class forecasting) means using an estimate based on a class of roughly similar previous cases, rather than trying to visualize the details of a process.
    EX1 : estimating the completion time of a programming project based on how long similar projects have taken in the past, rather than by drawing up a graph of tasks and their expected completion times.
  Seeing with fresh eyes
    DEF : A sequence on the incredibly difficult feat of getting your brain to actually think about something, instead of instantly stopping on the first thought that comes to mind.

Religion
  Appeal to faith
    DEF : If the arguer relies on faith as the bases of his argument, then you can gain little from further discussion. Faith, by definition, relies on a belief that does not rest on logic or evidence. Faith depends on irrational thought and produces intransigence.
    EX1 : If you have no faith, you cannot learn
  Crisis of faith
    DEF : A combined technique for recognizing and eradicating the whole systems of mutually-supporting false beliefs. The technique involves systematic application of introspection, with the express intent to check the reliability of beliefs independently of the other beliefs that support them in the mind. The technique might be useful for the victims of affective death spirals, or any other systematic confusions, especially those supported by anti-epistemology.

Occam's razor
  Occam's razor
    DEF : Principle commonly stated as "Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity". When several theories are able to explain the same observations, Occam's razor suggests the simpler one is preferable.
  Kolmogorov complexity
    DEF : Given a string, the length of the shortest possible program that prints it.
  Solomonoff induction
    DEF : Formalized version of Occam's razor based on Kolmogorov complexity. Essentially: The prior probability of an observation(extra prior, prior to any other observation or measurement) is the inverse kolmogoroff complexity of the binary string encoding the world in which it occurs.
  Burdensome details
    DEF : Adding burdensome details to a theory may make it sound more plausible to human ears because of the representativeness heuristic, even as the story becomes normatively less probable.

Bayesianism
  Bayesian probability
    DEF : represents a level of certainty relating to a potential outcome or idea. This is in contrast to a frequentist probability that represents the frequency with which a particular outcome will occur over any number of trials. An event with Bayesian probability of .6 (or 60%) should be interpreted as stating "With confidence 60%, this event contains the true outcome", whereas a frequentist interpretation would view it as stating "Over 100 trials, we should observe event X approximately 60 times." The difference is more apparent when discussing ideas. A frequentist will not assign probability to an idea; either it is true or false and it cannot be true 6 times out of 10.
  Bayesian decision theory
    DEF : is a decision theory which is informed by Bayesian probability. It is a statistical system that tries to quantify the tradeoff between various decisions, making use of probabilities and costs.
  Bayesian
    DEF : Bayesian probability theory is the math of epistemic rationality, Bayesian decision theory is the math of instrumental rationality.
  Absolute certainty
    DEF : equivalent of Bayesian probability of 1. Losing an epistemic bet made with absolute certainty corresponds to receiving infinite negative payoff, according to the logarithmic proper scoring rule. Cromwell's rule states that the use of prior probabilities of 0 or 1 should be avoided, except when applied to statements that are logically true or false.

Util
  Utilitarianism
    DEF : A moral philosophy that says that what matters is the sum of everyone's welfare, or the "greatest good for the greatest number".
  Expected utility
    DEF : the expected value in terms of the utility produced by an action. It is the sum of the utility of each of its possible consequences, individually weighted by their respective probability of occurrence. rational decision maker will, when presented with a choice, take the action with the greatest expected utility.
  Utility function
    DEF : assigns numerical values ("utilities") to outcomes, in such a way that outcomes with higher utilities are always preferred to outcomes with lower utilities. These do not work very well in practice for individual humans
  Pascal's mugging
    DEF : Thought-experiment demonstrating a problem in expected utility maximization. A rational agent should choose actions whose outcomes, when weighed by their probability, have higher utility. But some very unlikely outcomes may have very great utilities, and these utilities can grow faster than the probability diminishes. Hence the agent should focus more on vastly improbable cases with implausibly high rewards.
  Felicific calculus
    DEF : The felicific calculus is an algorithm formulated by utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832) for calculating the degree or amount of pleasure that a specific action is likely to cause. Bentham, an ethical hedonist, believed the moral rightness or wrongness of an action to be a function of the amount of pleasure or pain that it produced. The felicific calculus could, in principle at least, determine the moral status of any considered act. The algorithm is also known as the utility calculus, the hedonistic calculus and the hedonic calculus. To be included in this calculation are several variables (or vectors), which Bentham called "circumstances". These are: Intensity: How strong is the pleasure? Duration: How long will the pleasure last? Certainty or uncertainty: How likely or unlikely is it that the pleasure will occur? Propinquity or remoteness: How soon will the pleasure occur? Fecundity: The probability that the action will be followed by sensations of the same kind. Purity: The probability that it will not be followed by sensations of the opposite kind. Extent: How many people will be affected?
  Hedons and dolors
    DEF : The units of measurements used in the felicific calculus may be termed hedons and dolors, similar to the utilitarian posends and negends.  

Lexicon
  Akrasia
    DEF : State of acting against one's better judgment.
  Alief
    DEF : An independent source of emotional reaction which can coexist with a contradictory belief.
    EX1 : The fear felt when a monster jumps out of the darkness in a scary movie is based on the alief that the monster is about to attack you, even though you believe that it cannot.
  Altruism
    DEF : Actions undertaken for the benefit of other people. 
    EX1 : If you do something to feel good about helping people, or even to be a better person in some spiritual sense, it isn't truly altruism.
  Anthropomorphism
    DEF : Attributing distinctly human characteristics to nonhuman processes.
  Anti-epistemology
    DEF : Bad explicit beliefs about rules of reasoning, usually developed in the course of protecting an existing false belief
  Anti-inductiveness
    DEF : The idea that the market would stop being efficient if everyone acted like it already was efficient.
    EX1 : A vote in a democracy (the more people that believe their vote counts towards the outcome of an election, the less their votes count).
    ALT : Reverse Tinkerbell effect
  Belief
    DEF : the mental state in which an individual holds a proposition to be true. 
  Beneffectance
    DEF : Tendency to perceive oneself as responsible for desirable outcomes but not responsible for undesirable ones.
  Causality
    DEF : Relationship between a cause and an effect, where the effect is a direct consequence of the cause.
  Compartmentalization
    DEF : Tendency to restrict application of a generally-applicable skill, such as scientific method, only to select few contexts.
  Confabulation
    DEF : Remembering something that never actually happened.
  Cryptomnesia
    DEF : Form of misattribution where a memory is mistaken for imagination.
  Consequentialism
    DEF : Ethical theory that people should choose the action that will result in the best outcome.
  Curiosity
    DEF : Curiosity seeks to annihilate itself; there is no curiosity that does not want an answer. 
  Defensibility
    DEF : Arguing that a policy is defensible rather than optimal or that it has some benefit compared to the null action rather than the best benefit of any action.
  Doubt
    DEF : The proper purpose of a doubt is to destroy its target belief if and only if it is false. 
  Egalitarianism
    DEF : The idea that everyone should be considered equal. Equal in merit, equal in opportunity, equal in morality, and equal in achievement.
  Evolutionary Context
    DEF : The sorts of situations and environments under which a species evolved. (as opposed to the context they are currently in, which is very different, and confuses them.)
  Framing
    DEF : Drawing different conclusions from the same information, depending on how that information is presented.
  Groupthink
    DEF : Tendency of humans to tend to agree with each other, and hold back objections or dissent even when the group is wrong.
  Hedonism
    DEF : A set of philosophies which hold that the highest goal is to maximize pleasure, or more precisely pleasure minus pain.
  Hypocrisy
    DEF : Act of claiming to motives, morals and standards one does not possess.
  Incredulity
    DEF : Spending emotional energy on incredulity wastes time you could be using to update. It repeatedly throws you back into the frame of the old, wrong viewpoint. It feeds your sense of righteous indignation at reality daring to contradict you.
  Luminosity
    DEF : Reflective awareness. A luminous mental state is one that you have and know that you have. 
  Mind-killer
    DEF : Name given to topics (such as politics) that tend to produce extremely biased discussions. Another cause of mind-killers is social taboo. Negative connotations are associated with some topics, thus creating a strong bias supported by signaling drives that makes non-negative characterization of these topics appear absurd.
  Password
    DEF : The answer you guess instead of actually understanding the problem.
  Persistence
    DEF : The unwanted recurrence of memories of a traumatic event.
  Phlogiston
    DEF : the 18 century's answer to the Elemental Fire of the Greek alchemists. Or Fake Causality.
  Prediction
    DEF : Statement or claim that a particular event will occur in the future in more certain terms than a forecast.
  Priming
    DEF : Psychological phenomenon that consists in early stimulus influencing later thoughts and behavior.
  Rationality
    DEF : The characteristic of thinking and acting optimally. An agent is rational if it wields its intelligence in such a way as to maximize the convergence between its beliefs and reality; and acts on these beliefs in such a manner as to maximize its chances of achieving whatever goals it has. 
  Rationalization
    DEF : Starts from a conclusion, and then works backward to arrive at arguments apparently favouring that conclusion. Rationalization argues for a side already selected.
  Reactance
    DEF : Tendency to do the opposite of what someone wants you to do out of a need to resist a perceived attempt to constrain your freedom of choice.
  Reductionism
    DEF : Disbelief that the higher levels of simplified multilevel models are out there in the territory, that concepts constructed by mind in themselves play a role in the behavior of reality.
  Science
    DEF : A collective process of developing, confirming and refining shared theories about how the world works.
  Signaling
    DEF : A method of conveying information among not-necessarily-trustworthy parties by performing an action which is more likely or less costly if the information is true than if it is not true.
  Status
    DEF : Real or perceived relative measure of social standing, which is a function of both resource control and how one is viewed by others.
  Stereotype
    DEF : Fixed and over generalized belief about a particular group or class of people.
  Suggestibility
    DEF : A form of misattribution where ideas suggested by a questioner are mistaken for memory.
  Superstimulus
    DEF : A stimulus that engages a sensitivity more strongly than anything that existed in the evolutionary context.
    EX1 : Unhealthy foods frequently contain more salt, fat and sugar than anything our ancestors ever ate. As such, humans frequently respond to the superstimulus of eating them in a way that undermines their function by eating so much unhealthy food that it lowers their reproductive fitness.
  Surprise
    DEF : Recognizing a fact that disagrees with your intuition as surprising is an important step in updating your worldview.
  Teleology
    DEF : The study of things that happen for the sake of their future consequences. The fallacious meaning of it is that events are the result of future events. The non-fallacious meaning is that it is the study of things that happen because of their intended results, where the intention existed in an actual mind in the prior past, and so was causally able to bring about the event by planning and acting. [TODO-WTF?]
  Truth
    DEF : The correspondence between and one's beliefs about reality and reality.
  Anchoring
    DEF : Relying too heavily on a past reference or on one piece of information when making decisions.
  Connotation
    DEF : Emotional association with a word.
  Maxentropy Prior
    DEF : [TODO]
  Adversarial process
    DEF : Form of truth-seeking or conflict resolution in which identifiable factions hold one-sided positions.
  Death spirals
    DEF : Cultishness is an empirical attractor in human groups, roughly an affective death spiral, plus peer pressure and outcasting behavior, plus defensiveness around something believed to have been perfected.
  Affective death spiral
    DEF : Positive attributes of a theory, person, or organization combine with the Halo effect in a feedback loop, resulting in the subject of the affective death spiral being held in higher and higher regard.
  Appeal to tradition
    DEF : [TODO]
    EX1 : just because people practice a tradition, says nothing about its viability.
  Aumann's agreement theorem
    DEF : Two agents acting rationally and with common knowledge of each other's beliefs cannot agree to disagree. 
    EX1 : More specifically, if two people are genuine Bayesians, share common priors, and have common knowledge of each other's current probability assignments, then they must have equal probability assignments.
  Bayes' theorem
    DEF : A law of probability that describes the proper way to incorporate new evidence into prior probabilities to form an updated probability estimate.
  Cox's theorem
    DEF : Roughly, that if your beliefs at any given time take the form of an assignment of a numerical "plausibility score" to every proposition, and if they satisfy a few plausible axioms, then your plausibilities must effectively be probabilities obeying the usual laws of probability theory, and your updating procedure must be the one implied by Bayes' theorem.
  Black swan
    DEF : is a high-impact event that is hard to predict, not accounted for, and therefore causes the model to break down when it occurs.
  Burch's law
    DEF : A corollary of Burch's Law is that any bias should be regarded as a potential vulnerability whereby the market can trick one into buying something one doesn't really want.
    EX1 : "I think people should have a right to be stupid and, if they have that right, the market's going to respond by supplying as much stupidity as can be sold." -Greg Burch
  Childhood amnesia
    DEF : The retention of few memories from before the age of four.
  Circular reasoning
    DEF : Taking as an assumption that which one aims to prove.
    EX1 : God exists, and is trustworthy, because the Bible says so; the Bible is trustworthy because God inspired it.
  Dangerous knowledge
    DEF : Intelligence, in order to be useful, must be used for something other than defeating itself.
  Defensive attribution hypothesis
    DEF : Attributing more blame to a harm-doer as the outcome becomes more severe or as personal or situational similarity to the victim increases.
  Just-world hypothesis
    DEF : Tendency for people to want to believe that the world is fundamentally just, causing them to rationalize an otherwise inexplicable injustice as deserved by the victims.
  Empathic inference
    DEF : It's an inference made about other person's mental states using your own brain as reference, by making your brain feel or think in the same way as the other person you can emulate their mental state and predict their reactions.
  Endowment effect
    EX1 : Tendency to demand much more to give up an object than they would be willing to pay to acquire it.
  Loss aversion
    EX1 : The disutility of giving up an object is greater than the utility associated with acquiring it.
  Epistemic luck
    DEF : You would have different beliefs if certain events in your life were different. How should you react to this fact?
  Intrinsic
    DEF : Ontologically basic entities, thoughts, beliefs, ideas, for which no justification is needed. For instance, belief that the self exists, (or that anything exists). The ability to identify "things". Fundamental directives (EG, pursuit of survival, reproduction). Much of the mind is, and aught be, fluid, self-organizing, built from a small set of axioms, an elegant core, but it's impossible to build a working agent without implanting it with a few assumptions, a few mechanisms that will just work straight away. These assumptions are the intrinsics.
  Acop / reflective protocol
    SYN : superrationality, but this is a terrible name which sounds like it means something really dumb, so if you use it with anyone who doesn't already know what it means they will assume you mean something really dumb and the conversation will catch on fire and collapse and you will not realize what has happened until it is too late. 
    DEF : A decisionmaking process that is acop is in some sense aware of its nature as an abstract entity shared between many minds, and makes rational decisions in light of this. Conventional rationality cannot do this, and frequently attacks itself as a result. Essentially: An acop agent will anticipate that agents with similarly sophisticated decision theories will commit to the same policies as it will, so it will choose policies that it will tolerate being reflected back at it, effectively coordinating its policy decisions (and consequent actions) with every other intelligent agent without ever needing to exchange information, without necessarily even knowing with certainty that the others exist. It is a partial antidote to moloch, making its subjects more trusting less competitive.
  Collective Aspiration [TODO-Rename]
    SYN : CEV, Coherent Extrapolated Volition, however "aspiration" is a real word that pretty much means what it sounds like it means so let's use that instead)
    DEF : "Yudkowsky advances the Coherent Extrapolated Volition (CEV) model. According to him, our coherent extrapolated volition is [a precise articulation of the] choices and the actions we would collectively take if "we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, and had grown up closer together." There is, right after that, an implication that an FAI researcher's goal is not to formalize the Aspiration, which is beyond them, but to build something that can formalize the aspiration. It's plausible, and it gives purpose to those who have, for lack of better words, strayed far from their designer's intents, but personally, I cannot accept that the aspirations of the human animal are not within reach of the same.  ~faun "Rather than a Friendly AI being designed directly by human programmers, it is to be designed by a seed AI programmed to first study human nature and then produce the AI which humanity would want, given sufficient time and insight, to arrive at a satisfactory answer. The appeal to an objective though contingent human nature(perhaps expressed, for mathematical purposes, in the form of a utility function or other decision-theoretic formalism), as providing the ultimate criterion of "Friendliness", is an answer to the meta-ethical problem of defining an objective morality; extrapolated volition is intended to be what humanity objectively would want, all things considered, but it can only be defined relative to the psychological and cognitive qualities of present-day, unextrapolated humanity. 
  Coherent Aggregated Volition
    DEF : A combination of the goals and beliefs of humanity at the present time.
  Measure
    DEF : The measure of a class of thing in an infinite set is the proportion of things in the set that are in the class.
  Anthropic Magnitude
    DEF : The measure of a witness. A bit of an overloaded term. May refer to the measure of a particular class of witness, a particular class of simulant, across a particular set of universes, or in a single universe/encoding, or across all universes.
  Chimera
    DEF : A word or concept that is such a ungainly bastard of a mosaic of divergent interpretations that it can have no elegant, or even functional, definition or articulation. Under an analytic eye, it may turn out that the chimera, by what few shreds of its definition we can obtain, is an all-encompassing or all-excluding category, that is, a useless word, that could not possibly mean what it is commonly thought to. In these cases we might say that the chimera is mythical, that it does not exist.
  White Whale
    DEF : An unattainable ideal, or an ideal for which the risk of failure outweighs the potential for success, which the subject pursues single-mindedly, obsessively, despite. For them, no amount of risk will seem to outweigh the tiny sliver of possibility of success. Their values may have calcified in an absolutist state, in which no other path but the pursuit of the whale seems worth considering.
  Mathplat
    DEF : (mathematical platonism, Ultimate Ensemble, Axiom of Void Musing) The proposition that there is no real distinction between conceptual self-consistency and concrete existence. Our physics are consistent, thus we exist. A truthy-feeling way of avoiding the question of Why is Anything. ~It is true that if a sun sets, it will rise soon after, regardless of whether any sun or planet ever really existed. Those are facts of the nature of suns and planets, and those facts exist independently of any physical objects that might have inspired them. ~Perhaps our lives are the same, just consequences to antecedents, hypotheticals pondering themselves from the inside.
  tectonics
    DEF : The practice of deliberately changing culture.
  lateralus
    DEF : An affliction, to fall for an illusion of inescapable cyclicality. Examples include the failure to recognize one's growth, inability to dream of unprecedented things, ceding to self-reinforcing systems, being jaded to hope, waiting for nonexistent chickens to hatch from nonexistent eggs(you need to conjure the eggs yourself). related: Black Swan Fallacy. To be blind to the possibility of unprecedented changes.
  souldeath
    DEF : A being undergoes souldeath if every single branch of the evolution of its identity (everything it could become without ceasing to be itself- without abruptly becoming someone else or dying) eventually comes to an end. If you believe in an infinite multiverse, this is probably not possible.
  rescue-net
    DEF : Assuming countably-infinite, equally-real universes (which is theI ultimate conclusion of mathematical-realism and other possible Tegmark-world systems), this would effectively result in a fractal of universes-resimulating-universes-resimulating-universes; or if there is an absolute upper bound on a coherent universe's complexity, universes-merely-resimulating-plausible-minds. A cosmology that assumes the combined truth of cognitive-patternism and mathematical-realist ensemble-universes, wherein all sufficiently advanced civilizations/singletons ultimately become aware of these principles, and ultimately apply acausal-trade behaviors to said system to derive absolute moral imperatives. The most likely imperative, arguably, is the creation of a rescue-net; other specific imperatives within this system may be able to be acausally inferred, but we haven't been able to formalize them yet.
  archipelago
    DEF : A state of states with the sole purpose of enabling its citizens to gather with and be governed by their own. Mencius Moldbug seems to think that the archipelago will emerge as a natural consequence of free market post-statism. This is one of the reasons Yarvin is a dangerous idiot. Guaranteeing individual freedom of movement would require a huge amount of deliberate intervention. He may simply be making this shit up in order to pull libertarianism down his sinkhole.
    SRC : http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/07/archipelago-and-atomic-communitarianism/ 
  Eudaimonia
    DEF : sometimes anglicized as eudaemonia or eudemonia /juːdᵻˈmoʊniə/, is a Greek word commonly translated as happiness or welfare; however, "human flourishing" has been proposed as a more accurate translation.
    ETC :  Etymologically, it consists of the words "eu" ("good") and "daimōn" ("spirit"). It is a central concept in Aristotelian ethics and political philosophy, along with the terms "aretē", most often translated as "virtue" or "excellence", and "phronesis", often translated as "practical or ethical wisdom".[2] In Aristotle's works, eudaimonia was (based on older Greek tradition) used as the term for the highest human good, and so it is the aim of practical philosophy, including ethics and political philosophy, to consider (and also experience) what it really is, and how it can be achieved. Discussion of the links between virtue of character (ethikē aretē) and happiness (eudaimonia) is one of the central concerns of ancient ethics, and a subject of much disagreement. As a result there are many varieties of eudaimonism. Two of the most influential forms are those of Aristotle[3] and the Stoics. Aristotle takes virtue and its exercise to be the most important constituent in eudaimonia but acknowledges also the importance of external goods such as health, wealth, and beauty. By contrast, the Stoics make virtue necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia and thus deny the necessity of external goods.
  Moral luck
    DEF : Tendency for people to ascribe greater or lesser moral standing based on the outcome of an event.
  Error of crowds
    DEF : is the idea that under some scoring rules, the average error becomes less than the error of the average, thus making the average belief tautologically worse than a belief of a random person. Compare this to the ideas of modesty argument and wisdom of the crowd. A related idea is that a popular belief is likely to be wrong because the less popular ones couldn't maintain support if they were worse than the popular one.
  Ethical injunction
    DEF : Rules not to do something even when it's the right thing to do. (That is, you refrain "even when your brain has computed it's the right thing to do", but this will just seem like "the right thing to do".)
  Expected value
    EX1 : When you roll a die, the expected value is (1+2+3+4+5+6)/6 = 3.5. (Since a die doesn't even have a face that says 3.5, this illustrates that very often, the "expected value" isn't a value you actually expect.)
  Instrumental value
    DEF : Value pursued for the purpose of achieving other values. Values which are pursued for their own sake are called terminal values.
  Extreme aversion
    DEF : Tendency to avoid extremes, and choose an option if it is the intermediate choice.
  Fake simplicity
    DEF : If you have a simple answer to a complex problem then it is probably a case whereby your beliefs appear to match the evidence much more strongly than they actually do.
  Fallacy of gray
    DEF : The false belief that because nothing is certain, everything is equally uncertain. It does not take into account that some things are more certain than others.
  Free will
    DEF : means our algorithm's ability to determine our actions. People often get confused over free will because they picture themselves as being restrained rather than part of physics. Yudowsky calls this view Requiredism, but most people just view this essentially as Compatibilism.
  Fundamental attribution error
    DEF : Tendency for people to over-emphasize personality-based explanations for behaviors observed in others while under-emphasizing the role and power of situational influences on the same behavior.
  Ultimate attribution error
    DEF : Occurs when negative behavior in one's own group is explained away as circumstantial, but negative behavior among outsiders is believed to be evidence of flaws in character.Similar to the fundamental attribution error, in this error a person is likely to make an internal attribution to an entire group instead of the individuals within the group.
  Use-mention error
    DEF : Confusing a word or a concept with something that supposedly exists.
    EX1 : An essay on THE HISTORY OF GOD does not refer to an actual god, but rather the history of the concept of god in human culture. To avoid confusion, people usually put the word or phrase in quotations.
  Great filter
    DEF : Proposed explanation for the Fermi Paradox. The development of intelligent life requires many steps, such as the emergence of single-celled life and the transition from unicellular to multicellular life forms. Since we have not observed intelligent life beyond our planet, there seems to be a developmental step that is so difficult and unlikely that it "filters out" nearly all civilizations before they can reach a space-faring stage.
  Group selection
    DEF : Incorrect belief about evolutionary theory that a feature of the organism is there for the good of the group.
  Observational selection
    DEF : Pointing out favorable circumstances while ignoring the unfavorable. Anyone who goes to Las Vegas gambling casinos will see people winning at the tables and slots. The casino managers make sure to install bells and whistles to announce the victors, while the losers never get mentioned. This may lead one to conclude that the chances of winning appear good while in actually just the reverse holds true.
  Human universal
    DEF : Donald E. Brown has compiled a list of over a hundred human universals - traits found in every culture ever studied, most of them so universal that anthropologists don't even bother to note them explicitly.[TODO-Wikipedia this]
  Hyperbolic discounting
    DEF : Tendency to have a stronger preference for more immediate payoffs relative to later payoffs, the closer to the present both payoffs are.  
  Inferential distance
    DEF : Gap between the background knowledge and epistemology of a person trying to explain an idea, and the background knowledge and epistemology of the person trying to understand it.
  Information cascade
    DEF : Occurs when people signal that they have information about something, but actually based their judgment on other people's signals, resulting in a self-reinforcing community opinion that does not necessarily reflect reality.
  Information hazard
    DEF : Risk that arises from the dissemination or the potential dissemination of (true) information that may cause harm or enable some agent to cause harm.
  Intellectual roles
    DEF : Group rationality may be improved when members of the group take on specific intellectual roles. While these roles may be incomplete on their own, each embodies an aspect of proper rationality. If certain roles are biased against, purposefully adopting them might reduce bias.
  Intuition pump
    DEF : In summary, they are thought experiments that highlight, or pumping, certain ideas, intuitions or concepts while attenuating others so as to make some conclusion obvious and simple to reach. The intuition pump is a carefully designed persuasion tool in which you check to see if the same intuitions still get pumped when you change certain settings in a thought experiment.
  Irrational escalation
    DEF : Tendency to make irrational decisions based upon rational decisions in the past or to justify actions already taken.
  Tip of the tongue phenomenon
    DEF : When a subject is able to recall parts of an item, or related information, but is frustratingly unable to recall the whole item. This is thought an instance of "blocking" where multiple similar memories are being recalled and interfere with each other.
  Least convenient possible world
    DEF : is a technique for enforcing intellectual honesty, to be used when arguing against an idea. The essence of the technique is to assume that all the specific details will align with the idea against which you are arguing, i.e. to consider the idea in the context of a least convenient possible world, where every circumstance is colluding against your objections and counterarguments. This approach ensures that your objections are strong enough, running minimal risk of being rationalizations for your position.
  Loaded questions
    DEF : Embodies an assumption that, if answered, indicates an implied agreement.
    EX1 : Have you stopped beating your wife yet?
  Meaningless questions
    DEF : If everything proved possible, then the possibility exists for the impossible, a contradiction. Although everything may not prove possible, there may occur an infinite number of possibilities as well as an infinite number of impossibilities.
    EX1 : "How high is up?" "Is everything possible?" "Up" describes a direction, not a measurable entity.
  Wrong questions
    DEF : A question about your map that wouldn't make sense if you had a more accurate map.
  Magical categories
    DEF : an English word which, although it sounds simple - hey, it's just one word, right? - is actually not simple, and furthermore, may be applied in a complicated way that drags in other considerations. Physical brains are not powerful enough to search all possibilities; we have to cut down the search space to possibilities that are likely to be good. Most of the "obviously bad" methods - those that would end up violating our other values, and so ranking very low in our preference ordering - do not even occur to us as possibilities.
  Motivated cognition
    DEF : The unconscious tendency of individuals to fit their processing of information to conclusions that suit some end or goal.
  Motivated skepticism
    DEF : Tendency of applying more skepticism to claims that you don't like (or intuitively disbelieve), than to claims that you do like
  Naïve cynicism
    DEF : Expecting more egocentric bias in others than in oneself.
  Naïve realism
    DEF : The belief that we see reality as it really is – objectively and without bias; that the facts are plain for all to see; that rational people will agree with us; and that those who don't are either uninformed, lazy, irrational, or biased.
  Non sequitur
    DEF : An inference or conclusion that does not follow from established premises or evidence.
    ENG : It does not follow
    EX1 : there occured an increase of births during the full moon. Conclusion, full moons cause birth rates to rise. But does a full moon actually cause more births, or did it occur for other reasons, perhaps from expected statistical variations?
  Reminiscence bump
    DEF : Tendency to recall more personal events from adolescence and early adulthood than from other lifetime periods.
  Rosy retrospection
    DEF : Tendency to rate past events more positively than they had actually rated them when the event occurred.
  Self-fulfilling prophecy
    DEF : Tendency to engage in behaviors that elicit results which will confirm our beliefs.
  Shannon information
    DEF : The Shannon entropy is a measure of the average information content one is missing when one does not know the value of the random variable.
  Trait ascription biased
    DEF : Tendency for people to view themselves as relatively variable in terms of personality, behavior, and mood while viewing others as much more predictable.

ETC [TODO]
  Moloch
    DEF : Personification of the prisoner's dilemma. The face of competitive games which demand great sacrifice of their participants. Poetic construct.
    SRC : slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/
  Anthropic Magnitude Metric[TODO]
    DEF : an anthromag metric of an encoding is the probability of that encoding observing its own existence from within its substrate.
  Scott Alexander, Yvain
    DEF : Much sanity. Very insightful.

  Counter man syndrome
    DEF : wherein a person behind a counter comes to believe that they know things they don't know, because, after all, they're the person behind the counter. So they can't just answer a question with "I don't know"... and thus they make something up, without really paying attention to the fact that they're making it up. Pretty soon, they don't know the difference between the facts and their made up stories
  Travis syndrome
    DEF : Overestimating the significance of the present. It is related to the enlightenment Idea of Progress and chronological snobbery with possibly an appeal to novelty logical fallacy being part of the bias.
  Other-optimizing
    DEF : Failure mode in which a person vastly overestimates their ability to optimize someone else's life, usually as a result of underestimating the differences between themselves and others, for example through the typical mind fallacy.
  Reversed stupidity is not intelligence
    DEF : "The world's greatest fool may say the Sun is shining, but that doesn't make it dark out.".
